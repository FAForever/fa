This document outlines some questions which the Council of Setons should debate and come to a consensus on.
It is not an exclusive list, but decisions here can give direction to contributors.

Should Shielding affect a nuclear blast wave, and/or be able to protect units from nuclear damage?
How should Torpedo Bombers behave?
What intel should be given to players regarding the upgrading of a unit which has been scouted?
Should Nuke Launchers and Defences stall completely when your economy is stalled?
Should units with toggleable weapons automatically toggle when manually told to attack a target, then toggle back on kill?
How should the Stealth system work?
Should dead planes grant intel until they hit the ground? Should they grant full intel, or just LOS?
Should the distribution of the outer ring damage of the game's Nukes be made more streamlined?
Should the Attack-Move Factory bug be fixed? Should a fix be followed by more efficient reclaim tools?
Should SCU-Presets have Adjacency bonuses applied to the cost of the enhancements?
