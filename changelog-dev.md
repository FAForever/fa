## Features

- (#4522) Add snowflakes to lobby

## Bug fixes

- (#4446) Remove abort button when connecting with matchmaking
    Data shows that the majority of games do not launch because players
    pre-maturely cancel during the connection phase

- (#4449) Fix encoding issues with preference file
    This caused a wide range of issues for various users, including the issue
    where mods could not be updated and that the mods shown activated when
    hosting a lobby isn't representative of what is actually enabled
