The Balance Team

## Bug fixes

- (#5222) Fix a resource glitch that allows the Megalith to produce units for free

- (#5221) Fix a bug with the animation of the Cybran extractors not stopping when upgrading

- (#5220) Fix a bug where the Wailer (Tech 3 Cybran gunship) would half its damage output

  This bug occurs when the Wailer would engage a ground target and an air target at the same time. The damage output of the air-to-ground weapons would be reduced by half

## Unit reworks

- (#4985, #5194, #5175) Rework the Mercy

  The mercy has been completely reworked. The role of the unit is changed from being a sniper to area denial

  With thanks to Deribus for the initial idea and implementation.
