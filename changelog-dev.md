## Bug fixes

- (#5159) Disable the rehost functionality

  The rehost functionality has been broken for quite a long time. It would not properly restart the game with the correct mods and previously private lobbies would become public. We've not managed to fix it for quite some time and as it confuses those who use it and therefore we've decided to disable it.

  You can still 'rehost' the usual way, and in that case, your mods will work too.

- (#5158) Fix a bug with the Cybran destroyer being stuck in the transition animation

- (#5155) Fix a bug where abandoned armies would not be defeated

- (#5155) Fix a bug in the campaign/co-op where naval rally points were ignored

- (#5155) Fix a bug in the campaign/co-op where the army brain was missing certain functions

- (#5148) Fix a bug with the file picker

  This refers to the in-game file picker that is used when loading up a save game or replay
