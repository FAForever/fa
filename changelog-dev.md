# Game version 3761 (27th of June, 2023)


The main objective of this patch is to enhance the viability of a diverse range of strategies by 
boosting raiding capabilities, balancing overpowered units, and introducing novel ways to utilize 
existing units.

This changelog is just a snippet of the total changelog. In this balance update, more than a hundred
units have been tweaked in some fashion. You can read the complete changelog by clicking on the 'Beta
Balance' button below. This snippet only includes bug fixes and unit reworks.

The Balance Team

## Bug fixes

- (#5222) Fix a resource glitch that allows the Megalith to produce units for free

- (#5221) Fix a bug with the animation of the Cybran extractors not stopping when upgrading

- (#5220) Fix a bug where the Wailer (Tech 3 Cybran gunship) would half its damage output

  This bug occurs when the Wailer would engage a ground target and an air target at the same time. The 
  damage output of the air-to-ground weapons would be reduced by half

## Unit reworks

- (#4985, #5194, #5175) Rework the Mercy

  The mercy has been completely reworked. The role of the unit is changed from being a sniper to area 
  denial. It now deals damage over time over a large area

  With thanks to Deribus for the initial idea and implementation.
