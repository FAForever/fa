# Game Version 3804

- (#6002) Fix a bug where the map would not reveal at the end of the game

- (#6007) Fix Siren uselessly trying to repair units when assisting them

- (#6015) Fix a bug with capping extractors via the context-based templates feature

It was no longer possible to create the mass storage template for tech 2 or higher extractors with tech 1 engineers.

## Features

- (#6015, #6016) Extend the context-based templates feature

The context-based templates feature generates and adjusts templates based on the context of your mouse. Globally speaking, this is one of two categories:

- (1) Mouse is over a unit or a build order

In this case the first template will always be the first buildable version of the unit that you're hovering over. Then additional templates may be introduced for common tasks, such as capping an extractor with storages.

The first 'template' acts like a color picker - it enables you to copy the unit you're hovering over and build more of them. 

- (2) Mouse is over a deposit, land or water

In this scenario you can easily create mass extractors, hydrocarbons and/or walled point defenses.

- (#6005) Remove the `BUILTBYEXPERIMENTALSUB` category from all units that previously had it. As this category was unused, the Tempest still functions as you would expect.
