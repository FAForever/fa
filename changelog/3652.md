# Patch 3652 (May 2, 2016)

### Lobby

- Name filter when selecting map
- Prevent host from changing player teams while he is ready
- Game quality in lobby now visible again
- Reduced autobalance random variation to get team setups with better overall quality
- Default to score off
- Stopped the map filter preventing the map selected in preferences from prior games from showing
- Tiny fix to flag layout
- Fixed descriptions for the AIx Omni option and Lobby Preset button

### UI

- Introduced Russian translations of many FAF additions to the game (Exotic_Retard and PerfectWay)
- Translate some FAF additions to Italian
- New keybindable action: 'soft_stop'
- Soft-stop will cancel all orders of a factory except their current one, if you soft-stop a factory with only one order it will get cleared
- Hold down Alt when giving a factory order to soft stop factory before issuing next order
- Multi-upgrade: Added UI support to upgrade structures several levels at once (i.e: cybran shields, hives, mexes, factories etc)
- Auto-overcharge: It's now possible to let overcharge fire automatically whenever you have the required power
- Order repair on a wreck to rebuild it if possible by some of the selected engineers. Those not able to rebuild the wreck will assist after the build starts.
- Units explicitly repairing (not assisting) a structure that dies will automatically try to rebuild it
- Refactor the income economy overlay not to show reclaim values appearing in the generated income column and do correct rounding of the numbers.
- Fixed bug with unit regen debuff not being visible in UI
- Fixed bug with buildpower not visible in unitview
- Score display in the top-right no longer counts reclaim into the Mass/Energy income shown in observer mode
- Allow Hotbuild to find Support Factories
- Allow the UI code to search active mods for unit icons. Mods will have to have the icons in the right place (/modname/icons/units/xxx_icon.dds). Confirmed working for Total Mayhem at least, and probably many more.
- Show ren_networkstats in Connectivity Screen (F11)
- Show name of the one resuming a paused game
- Reverted the change to T1 PD icons from 3641, so now they don't give free intel on mouse-over when trying to fake PD-wall with all-wall radar ghosts.
- Render build range of engineers using native overlay system instead of decal hack
- Enabled Pause button in replays
- In Units Manager, added more preset restrictions (e.g. No T1 spam, No Snipes, No TMLs)
- In Units Manager, separated some existing preset restrictions (e.g. game-enders, nukes) for better selection
- In Units Manager, added custom restrictions for all FA units
- In Units Manager, added custom restrictions for modded units when mods are activated
- In Units Manager, added mechanism for restricting units using preset restrictions and/or custom restrictions
- In Units Manager, added grouping of units based on faction, type, purpose, and tech level
- In Units Manager, added detailed tooltips with stats for weapons, defense, and eco for all units
- In Units Manager, added visualization of modded units using small purple icon with letter M
- In Units Manager, improved description of preset restrictions
- In Mods Manager, added filters for UI/Game/Disabled mods
- In Mods Manager, improved sorting mods by their activation status and names
- In Mods Manager, added cleanup of mod names with mismatching mod versions
- In Mods Manager, added mod versions next to mod names
- Added pre-loading and caching of blueprints for usage in the Units Manager

### Gameplay

- Teamkill is now detected and a player can make an explicit report
- Air units are now able to fire at water-landed transports
- Hoplite now calculate their aim correctly when firing at a fleeing target
- Slightly increased unit size(not hitbox) of T3 sniper bots, Othuum and Rhino to alleviate their weapon's ground-hitting ability
- Seraphim Experimental Nuke now deals damage to itself
- Cybran drones no longer leave wreckage when killed
- Defense structures now start rotated at their nearest enemy when built, if no enemies found they default at middle of map
- Removed friendly fire on Atlantis AA
- Locations of enemy civilian structures are now revealed at start of the game (lobby option)
- Navy units now should respect their max-range better when having move-attack order
- Set GuardReturnRadius to 3 as default, will make guarding / patrolling / move-attacking units less prone to move off their designated mission while hunting something
- Units moving on sea bottom now leave tread marks - they disappear faster though
- Re-enabled death animation on non-naval units
- Seraphim GW now uses all its 3 exits
- Spread attack targets are now spread more uniformly among all units during the initial attack orders, further ones are random.
- Diplomacy now allowed in Coop mode
- Allow Fatboy, Atlantis, Tempest and Czar to fire while building units
- Beam weapons now kill missiles they impact instead of wasting DPS for several ticks
- Aeon ACU upgrade "Chrono Dampener" won't stun allied units any more. Additionally, it will fire at predetermined ticks so the effects of multiple acu's do not stack.
- Increased TMD range by 1 and ROF by 0.2s to prevent a single TML killing a single TMD by using ground-fire to impact before the second TMD shot fires.
- Fixed Cybran T3 MAA doing friendly damage on 1 of its 2 AA weapons
- Fixed Cybran T3 MAA hitbox/bones making lots of units miss
- Fixed Seraphim T1 sub not being hit by torpedoes 80% of the time while surfaced.
- Enemy civilians are now colored in a unique red color
- Fixed bomb drop code and enabled it for Janus, and UEF/Cybran T1 Bombers to attempt improvement to bomb drop characteristics
- Allowed Aeon Aircraft Carrier to build Bombers and Gunships, same as the others.
- Fixed restriction system on Sim side such that it cannot be compromised by UI mods
- Fixed restriction system that prevented removing restrictions on already restricted units in scenario scripts

### Bugs

- Fixed free mass exploit with Megalith eggs
- Fixed bug with Cybran SCUs getting EMP for free
- Fixed bug with units getting invincible after a visit to their nearest carrier

- Shields now overkill damage correctly based on their type
- Fixed nukes over killing bubble shield base structure when out of range and shield up

- Fixed regen buffs from different sources not stacking properly. This should mean every possible interaction between veterancy, upgrades, and the Seraphim Regen Aura field all play nice
- Fixed Underwater Vision not being initialized on unit completion
- Fixed Engineers not properly reclaiming the target of an assisted, then stopped, Engineer
- Fixed UEF Drones being un-targetable by Interceptors
- Fixed UEF Drone collision detection, making it much easier for ground-based AA to hit them

- Nuclear explosions now behave predictably, always bypassing/ignoring bubble shielding

### Performance

- Optimization of score accumulation
- Tweaks to hive build effects to reduce performance impact

### Other
