Game version 3737 (15th of May, 2022)
===================================

### Features

 - (Engine patch) Introduction of alternative profiling function for better accuracy (ff630c8)

 - (Engine patch) Maximum game speed is set to +50 (adc06ef5)
    Note that the interface (for replays, for example) has not been adjusted yet. Usually anything
    above +10 is only applicable in the first few minutes of the game.

 - Add button to lobby to access patch notes (#3842)
    Another contribution of Rowey: introduces a button in the lobby to access the patch notes.

 - Add Cloak Enhancement restriction option (#3844)
    Allows the host to restrict the cloak enhancement of the Cybran ACU / SACU.

 - Add proper recursive logging (#3861, #3869) 
    Introduces the functions 'reprs' and 'reprsl'. They are abbreviations for 'Recursive printing safe' and
    'Recursive printing safe to log'. It introduces an alternative to 'repr' which can get stuck in a recursive
    loop when trying to stringify units, projectiles, weapons and / or props. The old repr functions is available
    as 'repru', which is an abbreviation for 'Recursive printing unsafe'. The function 'repr' refers to 'reprs'.

### Bug fixes

 - (Engine patch) Disable mesh rendering for minimap (#7)

 - (Engine patch) Fix a crash when restarting a map with a Salem (#6)

 - (Engine patch) Fix a crash when air units have a collision of 'None' (1b17fe7)

 - (Engine patch) Excludes negative income and problems from this (1b17fe7)
    The problem in question is complicated and happens in every game, but it noticeable when it
    happens to a commander. The negative income causes the commander to not be 'fully built', and that causes
    a player to lose the game. This could happen when the commander was being repaired.

 - (Engine patch) Fix a crash when the mouse is pointing towards the sky, away from the terrain (3bf0ba5)

 - Fix mass fabricator behavior for multiplayer (#3852)
    Fixes an issue where the new fabricators could seriously hamper the performance of the game

 - Fix reclaim effects (#3865) 
    Fixes an issue where the beam glitches out when reclaiming a unit

 - Fix destruction sound of units being played twice (#3868)
    Was especially noticeable on the Spiderbot

### Performance

 - (Engine patch) Improve performance of common table operations (ff630c8, da692d3)

 - Optimize abstract projectile classes (#3847, #3855, #3866, #3867)
    Further reduces the load on the CPU when projectiles are taking part in the simulation

 - Clean up defaultunits.lua (#3806) 
    Improves documentation, while removing engine calls, empty functions and duplicated code

### Other 

 - Fix coloring of lobby buttons (#3846) 
    Rowey has keen eyes - fixes a few textures having the wrong colors when in the lobby when
    you select the UEF faction
