- (#6110) Veterancy Fixes and Features
    - Volatile units (example: Paragon being killed by Mavor) will now give full veterancy credit on death, where before their own death weapon would "steal" some of the credit
    - Adds a new stat--'VetMassKillCredit`--which records the total mass killed by a unit without respect to the "one vet level per kill" guardrail
