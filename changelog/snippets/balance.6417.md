- (#6417) Reduce T2 Amphibious Tank vision by 2 to give them a weapon range disadvantage of 2 when behind enemy lines and lacking intel, similar to T2 land tanks. Riptide is an exception, as it already has a short 18 vision/weapon range.
    - Blaze: Vision radius 24 -> 22
    - Yenzyne: Vision radius 20 -> 18
    - Wagner: Vision radius 22 -> 20
