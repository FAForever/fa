- (#6481) Balance cost and DPS stats of T3 static artillery:
  1. Aeon Emissary set to 79k mass in proportion to old UEF artillery DPS/M.
  2. Artillery costs spread evenly across 70-79k mass. Artillery costs are not reduced below their current costs because that would make them come out earlier.
  3. Damage adjusted for more per-artillery variety in shots to kill T3 shields, while also evening out STK vs different faction T3 shields.
  4. Reload adjusted so that avg DPS vs T3 shields (this accounts for regen) per mass is equal to Aeon artillery.
