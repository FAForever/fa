- (#6672) Repairing air units via Air Staging is now free in terms energy cost. Additionally, the BuildTime of Air Staging Platforms is reduced, as even after several buffs, they were still very slow to build compared to other structures of the same tier. As a point of reference, a Tech 1 engineer takes 60 seconds to build factories, while Air Staging Platforms took 70 seconds to construct and are also cheaper.

  **All Air Staging Platforms:**
    - AI
      - RepairConsumeEnergy: 30 --> 0
      - RepairConsumeMass: 0 (unchanged)
    - Economy (structures only)
      - BuildTime: 350 --> 250 (70s --> 50s)
