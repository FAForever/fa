- (#6705) Adjust costs of Aeon ACU's range upgrade so that range + speed matches the cost of other factions' gun upgrades, and make the costs of speed and range equal to make it harder to rush either upgrade on small maps.

  - Aeon ACU (UAL0001):
    - First range upgrade:
      - Mass cost: 300 -> 400
      - Energy cost: 6000 -> 12000 (20 -> 30 energy per mass)
      - Buildtime: 350 -> 400
    - Fire rate upgrade:
      - Mass cost: 500 -> 400
      - Energy cost: 15000 -> 12000
      - Buildtime: 500 -> 400
