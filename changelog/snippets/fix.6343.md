- (#6343) Remove the `INSIGNIFICANTUNIT` category from the HARMS, to enable them to be transferred to other players again. This also fixes the bug which caused HARMS to get destroyed when their original owner died in a full share game. Additionally, removing the category also allows HARMS to benefit from veterancy again. They will now gain increased hit points and regen from veterancy, just like other units.
