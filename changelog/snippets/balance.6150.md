- (#6150) Reduce Salvation's maximum reload discount adjacency bonus from 42% to 20%.
  
  After being fixed a long time ago, the adjacency bonus made Salvation more effective than Mavor as a game ending artillery as recently discovered. Since Salvation's purpose is to be spammed en masse after a Paragon, and not to be built independently as a superior artillery piece, the adjacency bonus that makes building Salvation without Paragon overpowered is nerfed.
