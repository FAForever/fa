- (#6667) Add a new **ranked** victory condition: Decapitation

  Unlike Assassination, you do not lose control of your Army when your ACU is destroyed. Instead, you remain in control of your army until all ACUs on your team are destroyed.
  This makes ACU snipes less impactful: while you lose a strong unit, you still get to keep playing.

  With thanks to Sheikah for the original Decapitation mod, and thanks to Phong for suggesting its integration on the forums and on Github.
