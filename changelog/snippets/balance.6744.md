- (#6744) Buff Cybran navy's missile deflector TMD so that they can defend against missile cruisers of other factions. Since deflectors ignore missile HP, they are given less fire rate and range than the gun TMD of UEF and Seraphim.

  Cybran cruiser (URS0202) and carrier (URS0303) Missile Deflectors:
  - Reload time: 4/2.5 seconds -> 1.9 seconds
  - Range: 20/26 -> 44
  - Max target height: 8/10 -> infinite
