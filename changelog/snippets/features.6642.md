- (#6642) Enable the map preview in the in-game matchmaker lobby

  The map preview provides a campaign-like preview of the map along with which factions are starting where. It allows players to start pondering about the game before it launched.

  With thanks to Brutus5000 and Sheikah we now have a Grafana dashboard again. Grafana is an analytics-like tool for backend developers. It allows us to track how many lobbies succeed. We'll use this tool to evaluate whether the map preview has a (negative) impact on the number of games that succeed.
