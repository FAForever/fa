- (#6890) Increase the cost of the Cybran ACU's nano upgrade by 33%. It is meant to help defend against rambo ACUs at early T3 stage, but the low cost made it come out in mid T2 stage where Cybran was powerful enough. It was especially powerful in comparison to the Seraphim ACU's nano upgrade, which had the same HP, worse regen, a higher 1800 mass cost, and no personal stealth.
