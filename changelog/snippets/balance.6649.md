- (#6649) Nerf the frontal turret of the Seraphim Destroyer, as the unit has proven to be too strong in direct combat with other destroyers. To prevent it from becoming too weak against Tech 2 Torpedo Launchers due to this change, its torpedo defense is buffed in return. This should also make the unit more resilient against sub spam.
