- (#6634) Introduction of the new 'Wasteland' biome, rich of textures, decals and props.

A collection of textures dedicated to Supreme Commander map makers.

These are of worlds drab and dreary, forlorn and abandonded, mirthless. Perchance, a few may find beauty here in the scars on the cracked earth, or in the chaotic stains of bile in tepid cesspools. Perhaps the forgotten tarmacs of abandonded civilizations, or the orderliness of the unearthed networks of ancient cities may inspire the industrious to rebuild. One thing is certain, vibrant panoramas are not to be expected.

With the exception of a few decals, all texures have an albedo version and a normal version. Many decals also include a specular version. The layer texures are designed to look best at a scale between 15-30 and although they're seamless, they should be blended with other layers to reduce the significance of the repeating patterns.
