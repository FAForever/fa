- (#6406) Automatically eject people from a lobby when there is a missmatch in the game version

Players often mention how it is annoying that games desync as a game release happens. This happens even more frequently on the FAF Develop and FAF Beta Balance game types. With this change we introduce a guard to prevent players from joining a lobby when their game version does not match the game version of the host. If there is a missmatch, the host is informed in the chat and is encouraged to re-create the lobby.
