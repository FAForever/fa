- (#6283) Add feature to preview adjacent units while in build mode

When placing structures to build it has always been tricky to understand what units are (not) adjacent. With this new feature all adjacent units are marked with their unit icons. This way it's trivial to review what units are (not) adjacent.

The feature also works for drag building and for templates.

The feature can be disabled in the game options, see also: `Interface -> HUD -> Show adjacent units when building`
