- (#6154) Re-introduce the blinking lights feature

The blinking lights feature adds small particle effects to factories, storages, radars and sonars. They change color dynamically depending on the storage ratio of a given resource:

- Red: You have less 10% or less in storage.
- Yellow: You have between 10% and 90% in storage.
- Green: You have 90% or more in storage.

The blinking lights feature was removed from the game two years ago in favor of more performance. It is re-introduced now again because the impact is minimal at worst yet it makes the game feel more alive.
