- (#6043) The `BuildRate` and `BuildTime` stats of all Radars and Sonars are updated to be more streamlined. The build time of Tech 2 Sonars is corrected to ensure it is not longer than that of Tech 3 Sonars. Tech 3 Sonars get their very low build time increased, to compensate for their Tech 2 counterparts being much quicker to build and providing more build power.
  - Tech 1 Radars:
    - BuildRate: 14.08 --> 13
  - Tech 2 Radars:
    - BuildRate: 21.46 --> 20
    - BuildTime: 845 --> 780
  - Tech 3 Radars:
    - BuildTime: 2575 --> 2400
  - Tech 1 Sonars:
    - BuildRate: 14.08 --> 13
    - BuildTime: 127.5 --> 125
    - BuildCostEnergy: 1275 --> 1250
  - Tech 2 Sonars:
    - BuildRate: 15 --> 20
    - BuildTime: 1680 --> 780
    - BuildTime: 2120 --> 1040 (Seraphim)
  - Tech 3 Sonars:
    - BuildTime: 750 --> 1200
    - BuildTime: 900 --> 1400 (Cybran)
