- (#6606) Buff the power of sniper bots as they have become too expensive and micro-intensive to use compared to saving for a T4 to counter Bricks and Percivals. The changes improve the leniency for their micro and improve their firing accuracy.

  - **Aeon and Seraphim snipers (XAL0305 & XSL0305):**

    - Speed: 2.2 (Seraphim) / 2.4 (Aeon) -> 2.3 (Seraphim) / 2.5 (Aeon)

    - Firing Tolerance: 2 (Aeon) / 3 (Seraphim) / 0.5 (Seraphim sniper mode) -> 0 (all)

      This fixes them consistently missing shots while turning/retargeting.

    - Firing Randomness while moving: 0.4 (Seraphim) / 0.3 (Aeon) / 0.2 (Seraphim sniper mode) -> 0.18 / 0.1 / 0.05

      The firing randomness is reduced so that snipers can reliably hit T3 units at max range, since the random chance to miss was annoying and snipers no longer need such a downside due to their cost changes.

  - **Seraphim Sniper (XSL0305):**

    - Sniper mode speed: 1.65 -> 2.0

      The speed was uninentionally reduced from 1.8 to 1.65 due to the last speed nerf, which was excessive (an ACU is 1.7 speed for comparison). Since the sniper mode is a bit underused, the unintentional reduction is reverted and the speed is further buffed to 2.0 speed.

    There may be further changes to sniper mode next patch to make it more viable.
