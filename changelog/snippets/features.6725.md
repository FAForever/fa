- (#6725) Tactical Paint feature:

    This feature adds ability to draw lines during game which teammates and observers can see.
    It is possible thanks to [this binary patch](https://github.com/FAForever/FA-Binary-Patches/pull/110).

    - Adds canvas mode where you can draw lines with color of player's army. This mode is enabled via keybind "Toggle Tactical Paint canvas" under "'Tactical Paint" section.
    - When in paint mode you can draw lines holding left mouse button and erase them holding right mouse button.
    - These drawings are shared between teammates.
    - You can mute specific player if one annoys you.
    - Can be turned off completely (it is on by default).
    - These drawings are left in replays, so mind what you draw.
    - You can adjust duration of **your** drawings with maximum of 1 minute.
    - Observers see these between each over and can draw their own.
