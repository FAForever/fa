- (#6590) Reduce the damage of Aeon and Seraphim T2 PD, as they have better DPS/mass than the UEF PD, and the Aeon one has higher muzzle velocity while the Seraphim one has a beam weapon.

  - **Aeon T2 Point Defense (UAB2301):**
    - Damage: 600 -> 560 (DPS: 150 -> 140)

  - **Seraphim T2 Point Defense (XSB2301):**
    - Damage: 605 -> 550 (DPS: 151 -> 138)
