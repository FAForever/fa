- (#6590) Reduce the damage of Aeon and Seraphim T2 PD, as they have better DPS/mass than the UEF PD, and the Aeon one has higher muzzle velocity while the Seraphim one has a beam weapon.

  - Aeon T2 PD:
    - Damage: 600 -> 560 (DPS: 150 -> 140)
  - Seraphim T2 PD:
    - Damage: 605 -> 550 (DPS: 151 -> 138)

  For comparison, the Triad has 124 DPS, and all three PDs cost the same amount.
