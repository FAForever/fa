- (#6591) Buff UEF ACU Drone's rebuild costs by making it half the upgrade's cost. Previously it was too high due to not being changed alongside the upgrade's cost, and had an unreasonable drain for a T1 economy.
  Additionally, the drone now rebuilds based off the ACU's buildpower instead of a hardcoded 10 seconds.

    - **UEF ACU Drone (UEA0001):**
      - Rebuild mass cost: 160 -> 60
      - Rebuild energy cost: 1600 -> 800
      - Rebuild time: 10 seconds -> 200 buildtime
