- (#6410) Buff the cost of the Mercy to suit its new role of killing large numbers of low HP targets such as armies, T1 pgens, and engineers. The buildtime is reduced an extra amount compared to other costs since it is a kamikaze unit.

  - Mass Cost: 300 -> 230
  - Energy Cost: 6000 -> 4600
  - Build Time: 2000 -> 1200
