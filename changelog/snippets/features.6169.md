(#6169) Assisting engineers now track new construction
- When an assisted engineer starts a new construction before the current one is complete, any assisting engineers will switch over immediately instead of completing the old
- Engineers (and engineer pods) assisting UEF shoulder pods will assist with construction properly
- Assist commands for UEF shoulder pods are "sticky"--when the shoulder pod attaches to its parent, the assist orders are transferred to the parent. When it detaches the assist orders are reapplied.
