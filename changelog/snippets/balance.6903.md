- (#6903) While previous nerfs have greatly reduced the oppressiveness of the Seraphim T3 Submarine Hunter, it is evident that it remains overtuned, particularly concerning its defensive capabilities. Accordingly, its health and torpedo defenses are nerfed to allow for more counterplay with Coopers, Destroyers, other subs, and torpedo bombers. It regains some of the speed it lost in (#6584), to make it feel less sluggish to use and emphasize micro.
