- (#6880) Increase Seraphim T1 sub's anti-torpedo defense's reload time so that it is less dominant against other T1 subs, which slows down the snowball of T1 subs and allows a transition into T2 counters (T2 subs, Coopers, Seraphim and Aeon destroyers).

  - Seraphim T1 Submarine (XSS0203):
    - Anti-Torpedo Defense reload time: 5 sec -> 13 sec
