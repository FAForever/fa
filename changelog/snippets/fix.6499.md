- (#6499) Fix hard crash when exiting the game when a Salem is on land

    The Cybran Tech 2 Destroyer (Salem) has the special ability to move from water onto land. There was a bug in a special, alternative implementation introduced by FAForever. Together with an assembly patch this bug is now fixed.
