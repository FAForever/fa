- (#6671) Increase the rate at which the Paragon updates its resource production from every 5 ticks to every 1 tick.
  
  This makes the Paragon react faster to high drain, reducing how often resources stall, are overflowed, or completely missed. For example, Paragon can now refill energy used by overcharge.
