- (#6220) Improve the build range overlay's compatibility.
  - Add the overlay to engineer drones/pods.
  - Correctly display build ranges modded through `ModBlueprints()`.
  - Display the auto assist range of engineer stations instead of their build range.
    - This is only a -2 displayed range difference without mods, but it will be larger with mods.
