- (#6427) Add strong tracking capabilities (like the Seraphim SAM) to the AA of the Cybran carrier, Seraphim carrier, and Seraphim T3 Submarine so that they do not miss their shots.
    - Cybran carrier had an especially poor hit rate at the edge of its range since it had weak tracking but also could not lead its shots due to having tracking.
