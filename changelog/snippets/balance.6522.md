- (#6522, #6785) In #5725 the number of child projectiles for the Solace was accidentally increased from 2 to 3 resulting in massively increased total damage. This change is reversed only partially as the Solace was underused with the lower damage. In addition, the damage is now properly split from the main projectile to the child projectile, which comes into play when the main projectile falls on top of an enemy.

  **Solace: T3 Torpedo Bomber (XAA0306):**
  - Damage per volley: 6000 -> 5000
    - Number of child projectiles per torpedo: 3 -> 2
    - Main projectile damage: 400 -> 1000
    - Child projectile damage: 400 -> 500
