- (#6522) In #5725 the number of child projectiles was accidentally increased from 2 to 3 resulting in increased total damage (6k rather than 4k). This change was reversed and the damage is now properly split between child projectiles as well. To compensate the original projectile damage was multiplied by the number of child projectiles.

- Solace: T3 Torpedo Bomber (XAA0306)
    - Total Damage: 6000 --> 4000
