- (#5061, #6438) Add metamethods and utility functions for Vectors and Quaternions to simplify and clean up the code involving operations with them.
  - This **removes** the file `/lua/shared/quaternions.lua`, which was added in #4768 (Mar 4, 2023), so mods that use that file will have to be updated.
  - The metamethods (defined globally in `/lua/system/utils.lua`) include:
    - Vector/Vector2 addition/subtraction/negation
    - Vector/Vector2 * Scalar multiplication
    - Quaternion/Vector * Vector/Quaternion multiplication
    - Vector * Vector multiplication (cross product)
  - Since these are metamethods, they work on all instances of Vector/Vector2/Quaternion, without having to import anything.
  - The utility functions (have to be imported from `/lua/utilities.lua`) include:
    - Faster Lua versions of VDist2, VDist2Sq, VDot
    - `QuatFromRotation`: Creates a quaternion from an orientation axis and rotation angle.
    - `QuatFromXZDirection`: Returns the orientation quaternion given an XZ direction
    - `TranslateInXZDirection`: Translates the XZ coordinates of a position by a length in a given quaternion orientation.
    - `RotateVectorByQuat`: Rotates a vector representing a 3D point by a quaternion rotation.
