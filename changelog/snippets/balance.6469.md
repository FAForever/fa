- (#6469) Unlike other Tech 2 units, the Fire Beetle only takes up one clamp on transports. This makes it possible to load the same quantities of Fire Beetles and Tech 1 units into transports. To ensure that the Fire Beetle does not slow transports down excessively, its `TransportSpeedReduction` stat is reduced to match that of Tech 1 units.
