- (#6424) Introduce total DPS and DPS/Mass calculations in the additional unit details displayed when `Show Armament Detail in Build Menu` is enabled in the settings. This is useful for summarizing or comparing the stats of units with multiple weapons. Previously, the DPS/Mass stat was not displayed in the UI or the unit databases, so they had to be calculated by hand.
    
    - For example, the Ythotha (Seraphim Experimental Assault Bot), which has multiple weapons, is now displayed as possessing a combined total of `3794` direct fire DPS. This is displayed in an additional field in the UI, the stats of the individual weapons of the unit remain accessible in the same locations as before.
