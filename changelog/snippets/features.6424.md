- (#6424) Calculate DPS totals in the additional unit details displayed when `Show Armament Detail in Build Menu` is enabled in the settings. This is useful for summarizing or comparing the stats of units with multiple instances of the same weapon, or multiple weapons of a similar type. If the unit only possesses one valid weapon, the total is not calculated.
    
    - For example, the Ythotha (Seraphim Experimental Assault Bot), which has multiple weapons, is now displayed as possessing a combined total of `3794` direct fire DPS. This is displayed in an additional field in the UI, the stats of the individual weapons of the unit remain accessible in the same locations as before.

- (#6424) Do not display the Mole's Target Tracker in the additional unit details displayed when `Show Armament Detail in Build Menu` is enabled.
