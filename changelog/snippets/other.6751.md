- (#6751) Split up the 'Extended Graphics' option 

  The option had multiple responsibilities. It is now split up into:
  - A new game option to adjust the shadow resolution. This allows you to have crispier shadows.
  - Extends the level of detail with an 'Extreme' setting. This allows you to extend the rendering distance even further, at the risk of being unstable.
