- (#6060, #6296) Make static shields absorb ACU explosions.

  Static shields absorb full damage from ACU explosions. For example, this prevents ACU explosions from killing all engineers inside shielded bases/firebases.
  Mobile shields do not absorb damage from ACU explosions because the ACU explosion is an anti-snowball mechanic and it would be very unfair for Aeon and UEF T2 to ignore it.

  The structure part of static shields still takes reduced structure damage from ACU explosions.
