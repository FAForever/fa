- (#6060) Make shields absorb ACU explosions.

  Both mobile and static shields absorb full damage from ACU explosions. For example, this prevents ACU explosions from killing all engineers inside shielded bases/firebases or killing all units in mobile-shielded T2 armies.
  The structure part of static shields still takes reduced structure damage from ACU explosions.
