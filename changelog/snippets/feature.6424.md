- (#6424) Introduce total DPS and DPS/Mass calculations in the additional unit details displayed when `Show Armament Detail in Build Menu` is enabled in the settings. Previously, these stats were not displayed in the UI or the unit databases, so they had to be calculated by hand.
    
    - For example, the Ythotha (Seraphim Experimental Assault Bot) is now displayed as possessing a combined total of `3794` DPS against ground targets. This is an additional field in the UI, the stats of the individual weapons of the unit remain in place.
