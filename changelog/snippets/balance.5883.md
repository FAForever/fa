- (#5883) Allow Chrono Dampener to fire immediately when a unit comes into range.

  Previously, Chrono was synced to game time to prevent stunlocking. Now, units have a cooldown before they can be stunned by any Chrono, which prevents stunlocking while allowing the new Chrono to be more responsive.
