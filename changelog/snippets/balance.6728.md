- (#6728) Improve Othuum's ranged capabilities and pathfinding so that it can better compete with higher range units, particularly Harbingers.

  **Othuum: T3 Siege Tank (XSL0303):**
    - Thau Cannon:
      - Reload time: 4.0 -> 3.4 seconds (DPS 156 -> 184)
      - Muzzle velocity: 40 -> 36
    - Aire-au Bolters:
      - Damage: 64 -> 57 (DPS 256 -> 228)
      
    Some DPS is shifted to the long range weapon to help in low unit scenarios such as raids or early T3 fights, in which Othuums were losing without even dealing much damage.

    The muzzle velocity is slightly reduced to encourage occassional dodging.

    - Collision Size Z: 2.3 -> 2.0
    - Collision offset Z: 0 -> 0.2

    This reduces how often Othuums in larger formations bump into the rear of the Othuum in front of them, which is especially critical due to the short range of the unit.
