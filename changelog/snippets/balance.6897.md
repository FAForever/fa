- (#6897) Add energy consumption for beetles cloak. Currently beetles are the only cloaked unit that has no E drain. Every other cloak (mole, selen, acu) or stealth (both personal and field) in the game consumes E. Not only beetles are weird exception from this rule, it allows them to be rushed at early T2 stage using combined low build cost and low e cost. This change will slightly nerf beetles rush pre-T2 pgen and make it pay for its cloak.
  - **"Fire Beetle" Mobile Bomb (XRL0302)**:
    - Energy consumption: 0 -> 10
