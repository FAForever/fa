- (#6383) The Soul Ripper's Iridium Rocket Packs gain the same area of effect radius as its primary weapons. Visually, these weapons appeared like they dealt damage in an area of effect, however, this was never the case. Due to being very inaccurate, this caused them to underperform against smaller units.

      - DamageRadius: 0 --> 3
