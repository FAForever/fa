-(#6690) Buff UEF Destroyer DPS, speed, and turn rate at cost of HP.

  - UEF Destroyer "Valiant" (`UES0201`):
    - Help the destroyer take better fights:
      - Max speed/acceleration/braking: 5.0 -> 5.5
      - Turn rate: 50 -> 55
    - Revert the HP buff and buff DPS instead so that more proactive usage of the destroyer is better rewarded:
      - Gauss cannon damage (DPS): 275 (275) -> 305 (305)
        - It can now 6 shot exodus (6600 -> 7320 damage per 6 volleys); it is unlikely due to inaccuracy, but it is worth noting.
      - HP: 8000 -> 7200
