- (#6476) When the Nano-Repair upgrade was introduced to the Cybran ACU, the `MuzzleSalvoSize` of its torpedo upgrade was nerfed to prevent the combination from being too oppressive. Unfortunately, this change resulted in the torpedo upgrade being weak even against lower quantities of torpedo defenses, since a single anti-torpedo projectile can negate 500 damage. To alleviate this issue, the torpedo upgrade now launches `3` instead of `2` torpedoes, but at a slightly lower DPS. Additionally, as with most other Cybran torpedoes, their damage is now dealt in multiple pulses.

  - Cybran Armored Command Unit (URL0001):

      - MuzzleSalvoSize: 2 --> 3
      - DPS: 250 --> 225
