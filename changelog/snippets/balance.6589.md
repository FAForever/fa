- (#6589) Increase the UEF T3 shield's regen start time (the amount of time after taking damage before regeneration starts) to make it consistent with other shields, as it was missed by accident during regen start time changes a long time ago.
    
    - UEF T3 Shield Generator:
      - Regen start time: 1 -> 3 seconds
