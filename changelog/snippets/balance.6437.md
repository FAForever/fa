- (#6437) Automatically rotate Cybran Carrier, Othuum, and Monkeylord towards their targets when idle or attacking so that all their weapons can fire.
    - Monkeylord will not automatically rotate when the laser is firing, to make it get in the way of micro less.
    - The units rotate in place when aiming like this.
