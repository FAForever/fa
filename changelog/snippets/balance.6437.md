- (#6437) Automatically rotate Cybran Carrier, Othuum, and Monkeylord towards their targets when idle or attacking so that all their weapons can fire.
    - Monkeylord does not automatically rotate when the laser is firing, to avoid interfering with micro.
    - Units rotate in place while aiming, so formations do not get disrupted.
