- (#6414) Adjust the Cooper's stats to compensate for previous changes to its hitbox, which allowed torpedoes to hit it more reliably. This also serves an additional buff to the Cooper, as it was the primary reason UEF navy underperformed in certain situations. UEF naval gameplay now relies less on building as few Coopers as you can get away with, and overbuilding them is less punishing.
