- (#6120) The range of the Tempest is nerfed, as it has become too oppressive. The nerf aims to increase the importance of good micro and allows for more interactions with your opponent. The Oblivion cannons of the Omen are tweaked to make microing against it more rewarding. The range of the Summit is lowered to promote closer engagements with other battleships. As a compensation, it regains some of its AoE that FAF removed, which also better matches the strength and size of its cannons.
