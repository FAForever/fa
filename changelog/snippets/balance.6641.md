- (#6641) Nerf the Brick against Percivals and other T3, as the 32 -> 34 range buff from #5547 made it obsolete Percivals and a bit too strong against Harbingers/Othuums, which resulted in huge spam of Bricks instead of moving onto the other units in the Cybran faction.

  - **The Brick: T3 Armored Assault Bot (XRL0305):**
    - Heavy Disintegrator Pulse Laser
        - Max radius: 34 -> 33

          The range reduction gives back Percivals a decisive advantage when retreating from chasing Bricks.
          <br> It also reduces the amount of damage Harbingers take when chasing down bricks.

        - Damage (DPS): 125 (312.5) -> 118 (295)

          Since the Brick still has 1 more range than before, this small DPS nerf further reduces how much damage overall the Brick can inflict to approaching Harbingers/Othuums or Percivals it gets in range of.

    - Turn rate: 68.75 -> 75

      With the 1 range reduction, Bricks would need a slightly faster reaction time when used against ACUs. This turn rate buff counteracts that, as Bricks got a range buff to deal with ACUs in the first place.
      <br> It also slightly improves the Brick's micro potential against Percivals and its ability to choose fights, which slightly counteracts the potential snowballing effects of the DPS reduction.
