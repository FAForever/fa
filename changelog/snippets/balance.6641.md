- (#6641) Nerf the Brick against Percivals and other T3, as the 32 -> 34 range buff from #5547 made it obsolete Percivals and a bit too strong against Harbingers/Othuums, which resulted in huge spam of Bricks instead of moving onto the other units in the Cybran faction.

  - The Brick: T3 Armored Assault Bot (XRL0305):
    - Heavy Disintegrator Pulse Laser
        - Max radius: 34 -> 33

          The range reduction gives back Percivals a decisive advantage when retreating from chasing Bricks.
          <br> It also reduces the amount of damage Harbingers take when chasing down bricks.

        - Damage (DPS): 125 (312.5) -> 120 (300)

          Since the Brick still has 1 more range than before, this small DPS nerf further reduces how much damage overall the Brick can inflict to approaching Harbingers/Othuums.

    - Health: 7500 -> 7250

      A key point of this health reduction is that Percivals now take 5 shots to kill a brick, instead of 6 shots with the 6th shot overkilling by 1200 out of 1450 damage, so Percivals are now much stronger against Bricks in a plain fight without supporting DPS. Even though the plain matchup is no longer close, Bricks can still win against Percivals by dodging shots.
      <br> The health reduction also very slightly helps Harbingers and Othuums kill Bricks they get in range of.
