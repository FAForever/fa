# Game Version 3780 (26th of January, 2024)

## Bug Fixes

- (#5897) Fix wrecks that sink to end up below the terrain

- (#5896) Fix Corona and Swiftwind being unable to hit landed air units

- (#5888) Fix dispersing veterancy to allied units

- (#5880) Fix strategic missile launchers losing progress when adjacency changes

- (#5878) Fix the Volcano being able to redirect strategic missiles

- (#5879) Fix various air units when landed being impossible to hit with non-splash weaponry 

- (#5931) Fix the bug related to capture time and costs for factories that are building units

The unit they were constructing would inflate the capture time and cost of the factory itself.

## Balance

- (#5898) Rework projectile counts on torpedo bombers

The projectile count was excessive and a large quantity of torpedo bombers could consume a significant chunk of the available budget for the simulation. At the same time we increase the projectile count of the Solace to make it less susceptible by torpedo defenses. 

- Solace (XAA0306): increase salvo size from 4 to 5 but keep the same total damage output
- Skimmer (UAA0204): reduce salvo size from 5 to 4
- Stork (UEA0204): reduce salvo size from 5 to 4
- Cormorant (URA0204): reduce salvo size from 5 to 4
- Uosioz (XSA0204): reduce salvo size from 5 to 2

Note that the projectile of the Uosioz splits upon impacting the water and therefore the actual projectile count is 6.

- (#5910) Adjust the path finding behavior of the Blaze and the Zthuee

The main weapon is now a turret like the majority of the units. As a result the weapon no longer negatively influences the pathfinding behavior of the unit.

- (#5884) The Chrono Dampener enhancement can now fire while being underwater

- (#5849)

## Features

- (#5907, #5904, #5900) Variable teleport duration and costs

Teleport duration and energy costs now increase as you're trying to jump further. The minimum is a duration of 15 seconds at a cost of 5.000 energy per second. The maximum is a duration of 50 seconds at a cost of 50.000 energy per second. The maximum can only be reached on maps of size 40x40 or larger.

This is implemented as an alternative to a maximum teleport range. This implementation still allows people to jump as far as they wish but they're naturally constrained by their own economy.

The expected costs of the teleport are displayed next to the cursor when you're trying to issue a teleport order. This uses the distance from the world position of the cursor to the unit. When you hold shift it instead uses the distance from the world position of the cursor to the last move and/or teleport order of the unit.

- (#5860) Further improve the context-based templates feature

You can now cycle through templates of a given context in the following order:

- (1) The build context
- (2) The build order the cursor is hovering over
- (3) The unit the cursor is hovering over
- (4) The deposit the cursor is hovering over
- (5) The layer (land/water) the cursor is hovering over

The templates you are cycling through are now preserved until you exit command mode. That means once you enter command mode by cycling you keep on cycling through the same templates.

- (#5846, 5915) Further improvements to the behavior of tactical missiles

- (#5923) Add the ability to load into transports by right clicking the transport button.

This triggers the same behavior as the 'Load into transports' hotkey.

## Graphics

- (#5887) Significant improvements to the graphics of the various UEF units.

With thanks to Ajamajan the Mongoose, Frigate and Destroyer finally received the attention that they need. The quality of the textures of the first level of detail (LOD0) have improved significantly and the units are now visually on-par with the rest of the UEF arsenal.

- (#5911) Improve the effects surrounding Seraphim torpedo's

The split effect is now applied when Seraphim torpedo's split.

Seraphim stationary torpedo defenses now drop their torpedo's into the water instead of them flying across the water surface.

- (#5892, #5890) Improve various details on the Thunderhead and Valiant Class UEF naval units

The rotators now gradually stop rotating when the unit is sinking. 

## AI

- (#5866) Fix submarines surfacing when leaving the factory.

- (#5872) Improve the behavior surrounding AI rating

They are now taking into account when computing the game quality.

## Other Changes

- (#5861) Reduce the overhead of various navigational functions

- (#5863) Add an alternative, more detailed version of computing valid nearby positions

- (#5865) Add various categories to various units

These are used by key bindings and the UI to understand what the units are capable of.

- (#5870, #5858) Improve the descriptions of a wide range of units

- (#5873) Reduce the lifetime of scorchmarks created by forest fires

They would previously last between 300 to 90.000 seconds.

- (#5864) Fix the pin feature of the minimap not being stored in the preference file

- (#5875) The upgraded kennel can now be drag-build when spawning it in via the cheat menu

- (#5921) Align the target priorities of the Continental with other similar weapons
