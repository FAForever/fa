# Game Version 3780 (26th of January, 2024)

## Bug Fixes

- (#5897) Fix wrecks that sink to end up below the terrain

- (#5896) Fix Corona and Swiftwind being unable to hit landed air units

- (#5888) Fix dispersing veterancy to allied units

- (#5880) Fix strategic missile launchers losing progress when adjacency changes

- (#5878) Fix the Volcano being able to redirect strategic missiles

- (#5879) Fix various air units being impossible to hit with non-splash weaponry when landed

## Balance

- (#5898) Rework projectile counts on torpedo bombers

The projectile count was excessive and a large quantity of torpedo bombers could consume a significant chunk of the available budget for the simulation. At the same time we increase the projectile count of the Solace to make it less susceptible by torpedo defenses. 

- Solace (XAA0306): increase salvo size from 4 to 5 but keep the same total damage output
- Skimmer (UAA0204): reduce salvo size from 5 to 4
- Stork (UEA0204): reduce salvo size from 5 to 4
- Cormorant (URA0204): reduce salvo size from 5 to 4
- Uosioz (XSA0204): reduce salvo size from 5 to 2

Note that the projectile of the Uosioz splits upon impacting the water and therefore the actual projectile count is 6.

- (#5910) Adjust the path finding behavior of the Blaze and the Zthuee

The main weapon is now a turret like the majority of the units. As a result the weapon no longer negatively influences the pathfinding behavior of the unit.

- (#5884) The Chrono Dampener enhancement can now fire while being underwater

## Features

- (#5907, #5904, #5900) Variable teleport duration and costs

Teleport duration and energy costs now increase as you're trying to jump further. The minimum is a duration of 15 seconds at a cost of 5.000 energy per second. The maximum is a duration of 50 seconds at a cost of 50.000 energy per second. The maximum can only be reached on maps of size 40x40 or larger.

This is implemented as an alternative to a maximum teleport range. This implementation still allows people to jump as far as they wish but they're naturally constrained by their own economy.

The expected costs of the teleport are displayed next to the cursor when you're trying to issue a teleport order. This uses the distance from the world position of the cursor to the unit. When you hold shift it instead uses the distance from the world position of the cursor to the last move and/or teleport order of the unit.

- (#5860) Further improve the context-based templates feature

You can now cycle through templates of a given context in the following order:

- (1) The build context
- (2) The build order the cursor is hovering over
- (3) The unit the cursor is hovering over
- (4) The deposit the cursor is hovering over
- (5) The layer (land/water) the cursor is hovering over

The templates you are cycling through are now preserved until you exit command mode. That means once you enter command mode by cycling you keep on cycling through the same templates.

## Graphics

- (#5887) Significant improvements to the graphics of the Mongoose

With thanks to Ajamajan the Mongoose finally deserved the attention that it needs. The quality of the textures of the first level of detail (LOD0) have improved significantly and the unit is now visually on-par with the rest of the UEF arsenal.

- (#5911) Improve the effects surrounding Seraphim torpedo's

The split effect is now applied when Seraphim torpedo's split.

Seraphim stationary torpedo defenses now drop their torpedo's into the water instead of them flying over the water surface.

- (#5892, #5890) Improve various details on the Thunderhead and Valiant Class UEF naval units

The rotators now gradually stop rotating when the unit is sinking.
