## Bug fixes

- (#5153) Fix a bug with AI being buggy in the featured mod Nomads

- (#5159) Remove the rehost functionality

  The rehost functionality has been broken for quite a long time. It would not properly restart the
  game with the correct mods and previously private lobbies would become public. We've not managed to
  fix it for quite some time and it confuses those who use it. Therefore we've decided to remove it
  until we can find a proper fix.

  You can still 'rehost' the usual way, and in that case, your mods will work too.

- (#5158) Fix a bug with the Cybran destroyer being stuck in the transition animation
