# Game version 3740 (23th of June, 2022)

## Bug fixes

(#3987) Align the stun radius of a Medusa with its damage radius

(#3988) Fix the initialisation of a state as part of a simple class

(#3990) Fix various issues with transports for AIs
Specifically allows the AIs to properly understand the number of units that can be attached to a transport

## Features

(#3979) Improve campaign AI behavior
Includes various fixes for campaign behavior, specifically to their use of transports

(#3989, #3993) Allow all direct fire weapons to retarget as usual
Prevents units from 'being stuck' attacking a factory while an engineer is next to it. This type of issue
shows up a lot more often in matchmaking. Change made with thanks to a conversation on the forums.

    I'd also like to use this opportunity to note that we're making the game better for the community. If a change
    appears to be the reverse of that then we're always open to discuss why you think that is the case.

## Other changes

(#3962) Add annotation to campaign related files

(#3983) Fix the Russian translation to 'Depth charges'

(#3991) Prevent loading of the mod `Quality of Performance 2022`
It was damaging some of the optimalisations that were introduced the past few months. At the same time it
introduces a unit that is free and produces a lot of resources, but it is only available to the Cybran faction

(#3992) Adjust the spacing of tech 1 / tech 2 bombers / gunships
