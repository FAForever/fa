# Game Version 3779 (11th of January, 2024)

A new year that we can only start with new mechanics!

With gratitude to all those who took the time to report issues,

Happy holidays to those that celebrate them,

## Balance

- (#5815) Change to the target priorities of the Percival

The Percival will now prefer to fire at structures over firing at tech 1 units. It has similar targeting priorities to Snipers.

- (#5812) Improve the behavior of tactical missiles

The behavior of tactical missiles is improved across the board. 

The targeting behavior now takes into account the full orientation of the unit. Previously it would only take into account the orientation across the XZ-plane. Tactical missiles are now noticeable more accurate against units that are on a slope.

The zig zag behavior is adjusted to reduce the amount of zig zagging right before impact. Tactical missiles that use zig zagging are now noticeable more accurate. Primarily applies to Aeon tactical missiles.

These changes are with thanks to lL1l1.

- (#5806) Adjust the economy behavior of the Scry ability of the Eye of Rhianne.

It now behaves similar to other economy-consuming abilities.

- (#5667) Adjust the movement behavior of the Seraphim sniper

The movement reduction of the sniper mode is now only applied when the main weapon is on cooldown. This reduces the amount of micro that is required to use the sniper.

- (#5805) Buff to the standard resource allocation of the Seraphim SACUs

The Seraphim faction does not have a Resource Allocation System (RAS) on their SACUs. Instead, the standard resource production of the Seraphim SACUs is higher than the SACUs of other factions. With these changes we buff the standard resource production to 3 mass/second and 200 energy/second.

This is an experimental change, we may tweak it in the near future.

- (#5795) Shrink the collision shape of air units when they are landed.

The collision shape of air units is relatively large in comparison to the size of the unit. As a result they act as a giant bullet sponge the moment they are on the ground. The collision shape is now shrinked while landed to match the size of the mesh of the unit.

- (#5785) Fix various projectiles being unable to impact the water surface.

Most notable the UEF tech 2 Destroyer and various tactical missiles would not impact on the water surface.

## Bug Fixes

- (4c9b6b) Fix a bug that only triggers in the Nomads featured mod

- (#5818) Reduce the maximum attack radius of the Aeon Tactical Missile Defense (TMD)

The Volcano could try to intercept missiles that it would never be able to. Given that TMDs try not to overshoot their target it may cause other TMDs to ignore the missile.

- (6f3244) Fix a bug for the AI where the threat-based pathing  would return an incorrect result.

- (#5809) Fix a bug for the AI where it would confuse the type of expansions, overspending significant because of it.

- (#5804) Fix the Shard being able to evade beams.

- (#5795) Fix air units losing essentially all water vision once they have landed once.

## Other Changes

- (#5816) Show decimals of the build rate of units.

As an example, the build rate of a tech 3 engineer would previously show was '32' while it is actually '32.5'.

- (#5736) Fix the intel hotkey not showing for the Scry ability.

- (#5802) Add a silo hatch animation to the UEF ACU when it fires a missile.

There's a standard reload time that applies. This is most notable for the Billy. The hatch animation acts as a rough indication for this reload time.
