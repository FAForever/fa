## Features

- (#4770) Overhaul of the cheat menu
    The menu now inherits from the Window class, as a result it can be moved around and rescaled. Units
    can now be dragged into the game, instead of the old box spawn formation. Includes a section to
    spawn in props, meshes and a new section to preview and spawn in entire templates.

    This was long over due. The new cheat window is completely configurable, note the little wench next to the title.

## Bug fixes

- (#4805) Fix orientation of structures being applied multiple times after gifting or capturing

- (#4793) Fix disabling of the tabs (in the center) when you are in a replay and your focus army is defeated

- (#4807) Add a check before applying a platoon function to fix a co-op problem

- (#4804, #4813) Fix various options not listening to the game settings

     - Options for the plane height indicator
     - Toggle for rendering mouse positions when observing

- (#4809) Re-order the sync in an attempt to mitigate 'unknown results' of ladder games
