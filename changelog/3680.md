# Patch 3680 (11th May 2017)

### Gameplay

- New feature: Dead air unit wrecks now bounce off shields. The amount of bounce depends on the unit's momentum and angle of approach. Some of the crash damage is transferred to the shield. Unit wrecks can only bounce once. Doesn't affect Experimentals.
- Allow units in a transport which is shot down to leave wrecks at the crash site
- Allow the Novax to build a new Satellite if the old one dies. This can only happen if it is impacted by a Nuke or ctrl-k'ed
- Introduced code to slightly improve the way Tempest and Atlantis behave, particularly in being able to fire, in shallow waters
- Enabled fire states on TML and SML structures and units. This allows you to command multiple launchers to fire simultaneously at multiple targets
- Increased reconnect timeout from 45 to 90 seconds to better allow router reboots
- HARMS now sinks to a greater depth on completion
- Assist-Mex-To-Cap is now on by default
