# Game Version 3802 

## Bug Fixes

- (#5986) Fix a bug where experimental units leave no wreckage

- (#5997) Fix losing reclaim orders when distributing a large number of reclaim orders

Reclaim orders are now distributed in a similar fashion as move and build orders are. Each reclaim order is assigned to a single engineer. There is no redundancy anymore.

## Graphics

- (#5998) Further improvements to the assets of the Mongoose

With thanks to Ajamajan the Mongoose received a second round of attention. Do zoom in and give the results a good look in-game!

## Other Changes

- (#5995) Adds an event message when a player (un)pauses the game or self destructs units

The chat message is also visible in the game log that is shown in the client, which is useful for moderators.
