# Game Version 3809

## Bug Fixes

- (#6102) Fix Ahwassa's bomb dealing full damage to ASF.

- (#6106) Fix partially built units not transferring properly in Full Share.

- (#6121) Fix UEF SACU fire rate upgrade using inaccurate fire rate value.
  
  The upgrade displayed 1.82x fire rate, but in fact provided 2x fire rate because of how fire rate is rounded to game ticks.

- (#6105) Fix a typo in the script file of the Seraphim Tech 3 Mass Fabricator.

- (#6105) Fix the Seraphim Tech 3 Mass Fabricator's rotators not spinning down when production is disabled.

## Balance

- (#6060) Make shields absorb ACU explosions.

  Both mobile and static shields absorb full damage from ACU explosions. For example, this prevents ACU explosions from killing all engineers inside shielded bases/firebases or killing all units in mobile-shielded T2 armies.
  The structure part of static shields still takes reduced structure damage from ACU explosions.

- (#6073, #6094) Allow Mongoose to fire from transports.

- (#5901) Increase UEF T3 MAA's DPS and damage, and swap its speed with Aeon's T3 MAA.

  - Cougar: DPS: 176 -> 206, Damage per volley: 1200 -> 1400, Speed: 3.3 -> 3.5
  - Redeemer: Speed: 3.5 -> 3.3

  This brings its DPS closer in line with other factions, lets it 3 shot strategic bombers instead of 4 shot, and lets it better escort Titans/Parashields.
  Redeemer's extra speed wasn't very necessary for its role within Aeon, so it was chosen to be swapped with.

- (#5874) Fine tune the balance of the Tech 2 Navy stage.
    - Uashavoh: T2 Destroyer (XSS0201):
        - AntiTorpedo RateOfFire: 0.26 --> 0.3
    - Salem Class: T2 Destroyer (URS0201):
        - BackUpDistance: 5 --> 10
    - Cooper: T2 Torpedo Boat (XES0102):
        - Health: 1750 --> 2000

- (#5895) After receiving several buffs, the Seraphim Tech 3 Submarine Hunter has become too oppressive, especially in larger formations. These changes aim to bring it back in line, while keeping its identity.
    - Yathsou: T3 Submarine Hunter (XSS0304):
        - Damage: 290 --> 380
        - RateOfFire: 0.25 --> 0.22
        - MuzzleSalvoDelay: 0.7 --> 1
        - MuzzleSalvoSize: 5 --> 4
        - DPS: 363 --> 338
        - Torpedo Defense RateOfFire (x2): 0.15 --> 0.1

- (#6043) The `BuildRate` and `BuildTime` stats of all Radars and Sonars are updated to be more streamlined. The build time of Tech 2 Sonars is corrected to ensure it is not longer than that of Tech 3 Sonars. Tech 3 Sonars get their very low build time increased, to compensate for their Tech 2 counterparts being much quicker to build and providing more build power.
    - Tech 1 Radars
        - BuildRate: 14.08 --> 13
    - Tech 2 Radars
        - BuildRate: 21.46 --> 20
        - BuildTime: 845 --> 780
    - Tech 3 Radars
        - BuildTime: 2575 --> 2400
    - Tech 1 Sonars
        - BuildRate: 14.08 --> 13
        - BuildTime: 127.5 --> 125
        - BuildCostEnergy: 1275 --> 1250
    - Tech 2 Sonars
        - BuildRate: 15 --> 20
        - BuildTime: 1680 --> 780
        - BuildTime: 2120 --> 1040 (Seraphim)
    - Tech 3 Sonars
        - BuildTime: 750 --> 1200
        - BuildTime: 900 --> 1400 (Cybran)

- (#6082) The `BuildRate` and `BuildTime` stats of several Shield Generators are updated to be more streamlined. The Seraphim Tech 2 Shield Generator gains build power, as it previously had a very low amount. The Aeon Tech 2 Shield Generator loses its build power, as it cannot be upgraded.
    - Tech 2 Shield Generators
        - BuildRate: 13.66 --> 0 (Aeon)
        - BuildRate: 12.98 --> 20 (Seraphim)
        - BuildRate: 19.95 --> 20 (UEF)
    - Tech 3 Shield Generators
        - BuildTime: 5841 --> 5800 (Seraphim)
        - BuildTime: 4988 --> 5000 (UEF)

- (#6104) Reduce TML HP and add a Death Weapon
  - HP: 1500 --> 900
  - Death Weapon
    - Damage: 750
    - AoE (UEF/Aeon/Sera): 2
    - AoE (Cybran): 3
