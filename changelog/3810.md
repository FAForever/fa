# Game Version 3810

## Bug Fixes

- (#6102) Fix Ahwassa's bomb dealing full damage to ASF.

- (#6106) Fix partially built units not transferring properly in Full Share.

- (#6105) Fix a typo in the script file of the Seraphim Tech 3 Mass Fabricator.

- (#6105) Fix the Seraphim Tech 3 Mass Fabricator's rotators not spinning down when production is disabled.

## Balance

- (#6060) Make shields absorb ACU explosions.

  Both mobile and static shields absorb full damage from ACU explosions. For example, this prevents ACU explosions from killing all engineers inside shielded bases/firebases or killing all units in mobile-shielded T2 armies.
  The structure part of static shields still takes reduced structure damage from ACU explosions.

- (#6073, #6094) Allow Mongoose to fire from transports.

- (#5901) Increase UEF T3 MAA's DPS and damage, and swap its speed with Aeon's T3 MAA.

  - Cougar: DPS: 176 -> 206, Damage per volley: 1200 -> 1400, Speed: 3.3 -> 3.5
  - Redeemer: Speed: 3.5 -> 3.3

  This brings its DPS closer in line with other factions, lets it 3 shot strategic bombers instead of 4 shot, and lets it better escort Titans/Parashields.
  Redeemer's extra speed wasn't very necessary for its role within Aeon, so it was chosen to be swapped with.

- (#5874) Fine tune the balance of the Tech 2 Navy stage.
    - Uashavoh: T2 Destroyer (XSS0201):
        - AntiTorpedo RateOfFire: 0.26 --> 0.3
    - Salem Class: T2 Destroyer (URS0201):
        - BackUpDistance: 5 --> 10
    - Cooper: T2 Torpedo Boat (XES0102):
        - Health: 1750 --> 2000

- (#5895) After receiving several buffs, the Seraphim Tech 3 Submarine Hunter has become too oppressive, especially in larger formations. These changes aim to bring it back in line, while keeping its identity.
    - Yathsou: T3 Submarine Hunter (XSS0304):
        - Damage: 290 --> 380
        - RateOfFire: 0.25 --> 0.22
        - MuzzleSalvoDelay: 0.7 --> 1
        - MuzzleSalvoSize: 5 --> 4
        - DPS: 363 --> 338
        - Torpedo Defense RateOfFire (x2): 0.15 --> 0.1

- (#6043) The `BuildRate` and `BuildTime` stats of all Radars and Sonars are updated to be more streamlined. The build time of Tech 2 Sonars is corrected to ensure it is not longer than that of Tech 3 Sonars. Tech 3 Sonars get their very low build time increased, to compensate for their Tech 2 counterparts being much quicker to build and providing more build power.
    - Tech 1 Radars
        - BuildRate: 14.08 --> 13
    - Tech 2 Radars
        - BuildRate: 21.46 --> 20
        - BuildTime: 845 --> 780
    - Tech 3 Radars
        - BuildTime: 2575 --> 2400
    - Tech 1 Sonars
        - BuildRate: 14.08 --> 13
        - BuildTime: 127.5 --> 125
        - BuildCostEnergy: 1275 --> 1250
    - Tech 2 Sonars
        - BuildRate: 15 --> 20
        - BuildTime: 1680 --> 780
        - BuildTime: 2120 --> 1040 (Seraphim)
    - Tech 3 Sonars
        - BuildTime: 750 --> 1200
        - BuildTime: 900 --> 1400 (Cybran)

- (#6082) The `BuildRate` and `BuildTime` stats of several Shield Generators are updated to be more streamlined. The Seraphim Tech 2 Shield Generator gains build power, as it previously had a very low amount. The Aeon Tech 2 Shield Generator loses its build power, as it cannot be upgraded.
    - Tech 2 Shield Generators
        - BuildRate: 13.66 --> 0 (Aeon)
        - BuildRate: 12.98 --> 20 (Seraphim)
        - BuildRate: 19.95 --> 20 (UEF)
    - Tech 3 Shield Generators
        - BuildTime: 5841 --> 5800 (Seraphim)
        - BuildTime: 4988 --> 5000 (UEF)

- (#6104) Reduce TML HP and add a Death Weapon
  - HP: 1500 --> 900
  - Death Weapon
    - Damage: 750
    - AoE (UEF/Aeon/Sera): 2
    - AoE (Cybran): 3

- (#6125) Increase the hitpoints of the Aeon Tech 1 MAA so that it can survive a single bomb from a Seraphim Tech 1 bomber.
    - Thistle: T1 Mobile Anti-Air Gun (UAL0104):
        - MaxHealth: 250 --> 265

- (#6127) Allow the Selen to activate its cloak more quickly and increase the vision and radar radius it retains after cloaking itself.
    - Selen: T1 Combat Scout (XSL0101):
        - StealthWaitTime: 3 --> 1.5
        - VisionRadius while stealthed/cloaked: 0.6 --> 0.8
        - RadarRadius while stealthed/cloaked: 0.6 --> 0.8

## Features

- (#6079) Make various structures easier to place to help with base building.
    - All Tech 3 Power Generators, Tech 3 Mass Fabricators, Tech 3 Artilleries, Shield Structures, Land Factories and Air Factories:
        - MaxGroundVariation: 1.0 --> 1.1
    - All Game Enders except for the Scathis:
        - MaxGroundVariation: 1.0 --> 1.2
