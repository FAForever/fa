# Patch 3676 (27th February, 2017)

### Other

- Fixed wall segements giving full veterancy points. They give 0.1 per segment now to prevent abuse
- Changed the colours for the Hotbuild labels to make them clearer. Ctrl-SHORTCUT is now blue, and Alt-SHORTCUT is green
- Introduced UI elements for Attack-Move. Now shows a special cursor on pressing Alt, and has a new UI button which emulates the Alt-RMB command as closely as possible
- Stretched orders UI by 1 slot to make room for Attack-Move and other future additions or modded orders
