## Balance

- (#5901) Increase UEF T3 MAA's DPS and damage, and swap its speed with Aeon's T3 MAA.

  - Cougar: DPS: 176 -> 206, Damage per volley: 1200 -> 1400, Speed: 3.3 -> 3.5
  - Redeemer: Speed 3.5 -> 3.3

  This brings its DPS closer in line with other factions, lets it 3 shot strategic bombers instead of 4 shot, and lets it better escort Titans/Parashields.
  Redeemer's extra speed wasn't very necessary for its role within Aeon, so it was chosen to be swapped with.
