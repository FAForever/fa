### Gameplay

- New Feature: Integrated a vastly improved version of the popular Notify mod
  - Notify Features
    - Notify started as a way to allow ACU upgrade progress to be communicated nicely to the team. FAF has taken it to the next level.
    - Support for sending notifications about ACU upgrades, Factory Tech upgrades (HQs), Experimental construction, and Nuke and T3 Artillery construction
    - By default, you will see notifications about ACU upgrades only, as well as an ETA overlay at the location of the upgrading ACUs
    - Toggles available to define which types of messages you want to see come in from allies
    - Notify messages limited to only show the first of each HQ type, Experimental (Non game-ender), Nuke, or T3 Artillery to avoid spamming the chat with notifications late-game
  - Notify UI
    - Selecting your ACU will show any upgrades it has completed for each slot above the UI in the bottom left corner
    - There is an in-game customisation menu UI. It can be accessed via the main menu, or with a key bind. Default binding is CTRL-ALT-F1
    - Full customisation of all Notify messages is enabled, including resetting to default
    - All message types are broadcast at all times. The menu allows you to customise which messages you see, using toggle buttons at the top of the customiser.
    - Colour of Notify messages can be changed inside the chat window
  - Upgrade Queuing
    - ACU Upgrades can now be queued up the same as any other construction project
    - Unfortunately, due to an engine limitation, upgrades cannot be UN-queued (You can only stop the ACU, cancelling the in progress work orders)
    - ACUs can queue buildings from an uncompleted tech level if the upgrade is queued
    - Hotbuild has the ability to correctly access the uncompleted tech level buildings tooltip
  - Blacklisted all previous Notify mod versions
- Significantly improved unit formations
  - Changed land and naval formations to give large units extra space instead of forcing the whole group to spread out
  - Moved submarines so they sit between surface vessels instead of directly under them
  - Changed air formation shape to spread units out more evenly and make large formations wider instead of a long line
  - Made guard formation denser so more units can stay close to the target
  - Changed shield distribution in guard formation to more efficiently cover the target and other guarding units
  - Fixed several unit filter issues that caused units to get the wrong positions or even be excluded from a formation altogether
  - Rearranged land and naval formations to give some units better positions
- Improved spread attack. It now handles most order types.
- Changed the timeout on player attention pings to be per-player instead of on a global cooldown
- Fixed and optimised TML leading for AIs
- Increased the depth at which Megalith and Ythotha appear to be submerged in water instead of walking on land
- Reverted the Energy hotbuild cycling through to Storage, in response to popular demand.
- T3 Sonar can now be given assist commands. Primarily useful so they can guard a unit and stay with it.

- Increased Cybran SACU projectile lifetime so it can hit targets at the edge of its upgraded range
- Fixed some instances of transported units not dying when their transport dies
