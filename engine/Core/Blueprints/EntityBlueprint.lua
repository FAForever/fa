---@field Categories CategoryName[]
--- hash of category names that this entity belongs to
---@field CategoriesHash table<CategoryName, true>
--- shape to use for collisions with the entity
---@field CollisionShape CollisionShape
--- the desired maximum number of shooters taking shots at the entity
---@field DesiredShooterCap number
--- Unit footprint. If absent, uses the `SizeX` and `SizeZ` fields.
