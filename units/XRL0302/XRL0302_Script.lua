    -- three situations to ever blow up the bomb. The unit getting in range and firing, the
    -- player pressing the detonate button, or the player using CTRL-K to suicide the unit.

    -- Since the weapon itself kills the unit with self.unit:Destroy(), and CTRL-K detonates the
    -- weapon immediately thanks to selfdestruct.lua, we don't need any logic here for OnKilled()
