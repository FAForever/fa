**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Do not forget to append the game logs.

**To Reproduce**
A clear and concise set of instructions on how to reproduce the issue. Best accompanied with a sandboxed replay. An in-action replay is helpful but not sufficient - the burden to investigate how to reproduce the issue is then moved to the maintainer.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. 

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

_This bug report will be read by people that have not experienced the bug themselves - this report is all they have to investigate. The more precise your report, the easier it becomes for us to help you._
