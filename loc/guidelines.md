# Translation guidelines


1) *Compliance with the game's UI*

    - Text should never overflow
    - Maintain a few pixels of margin between the text and its parent element boundaries
    - Use obvious abbreviations if a shorter translation is impossible, but the abbreviation should be made in a way that it is clear and obvious. Keywords from the game should never be abbreviated.
&nbsp;
2) *Gender-neutral writing*

    - The translation should never adopt gendered formulations when addressing the player directly, and should respect gender-neutral writing everywhere possible
    - Median point and/or parentheses, or gendering a word twice, should be avoided to the maximum.
&nbsp;
3) *Consistency of keywords*

    - Game specific keywords, like unit names and building names, should always be translated in the same manner consistently across the whole game.
    - If a new keyword appears, that is not translated elsewhere, it should be translated in a consistent manner regarding the other translated keywords.
