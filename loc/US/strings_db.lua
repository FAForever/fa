SCMP_001_Description="Initial scans of the planet revealed evenly spaced hills, leading some to believe that the hills were ancient alien burial mounds. Subsequent scans disproved this theory, but many believe that the old Earth Empire actually found alien remains, spirited them away and then faked the scans as part of the cover-up."
SCMP_002_Description="Not technically a lake, but rather an upwelling of gases that have combined to form a 'water-like' liquid. Most of the gases are unknown and all three factions are eager to exploit the area and discover its secrets."
SCMP_003_Description="Named after a long-dead Imperial officer, Drake was sent in to quell a secessionist movement and found himself facing an organized army. He was forced to retreat to the opposite ridge of the ravine, and it was at that position he was able to get enough units online to fight back. Drake defeated the secessionists and the ravine has since borne his name."
SCMP_004_Description="Underwater for millennia, tectonic shifts have drained the Crater, exposing the Mass needed to continue the Infinite War. Sparse forests have sprung up in the intervening years, though they are often destroyed in the continuous fighting that rages in the Crater."
SCMP_005_Description="Once a haven for smugglers, the islands were named after the 'gentlemen' that did business there. Now the islands host a different kind of gentleman, Commanders from the three factions who vie with each other for control of the planet."
SCMP_006_Description="Named for an early explorer, Ian's Cross has witnessed countless battles. The relatively open area and plentiful Mass deposits have encouraged continual battles for several years."
SCMP_007_Description="A small strip of green surrounded by ice and snow, no one is really sure who first called this area Open Palms. Legend has it that originally this was neutral ground, where soldiers of any faction could come without fear of attack. Hence, all who came had 'open palms,' meaning no weapons were carried."
SCMP_008_Description="For years, these glaciers had been mined by the Aeon, who gave them their name. However, with the ebb and flow of battle, the Aeon have been driven off and the glaciers will belong to whomever can hold them."
SCMP_009_Description="Dozens of battles have been fought over the years across Seton's Clutch. A patient searcher could find the remains of thousands of units resting beneath the earth and under the waves."
SCMP_010_Description="A warlord called Sung once called this island home. He chose it for both its great beauty and abundant resources. Sung has long since been driven off, but the resources remain for whoever can take them."
SCMP_011_Description="Once a small continent, the UEF constructed a research base here for advanced weapons testing. The researchers lost control of an experimental weapon and the resulting explosion decimated the continent, ripping it into a few scattered islands. Now all three factions are attempting to find evidence of this weapon for their own purposes."
SCMP_012_Description="In the early days of the settlement, wayfarers knew to go through the arch and head due north to reach civilization. These days, the Passage is much more dangerous, thanks to the constant fighting that moves back and forth across the desert."
SCMP_013_Description="Sometimes two Commanders need a private place to conduct a private fight. Winter Duel is the arena of choice when the battle has become personal."
SCMP_014_Description="Old mariner's tales speak of the Bermuda Triangle, where ships would disappear without a trace. The Bermuda Locket has much the same reputation, save that it's Commanders who never return."
SCMP_015_Description="With almost no water and little vegetation, there is very little reason to come to the Fields. However, it does possess abundant Mass , which makes it a natural place for Commanders to fight."
SCMP_016_Description="Canis River is known for two things. The first is the river, which is home to mineral deposits, especially gold. The second is that it's ideal for a one-on-one fight."
SCMP_017_Description="This place is unremarkable in every respect. However, it does sit on a major Gate hub, offering easy access to a good portion of the galaxy. For this reason alone, many Commanders have fought to the death to claim this place."
SCMP_018_Description="When this region was originally settled, towers were placed on the hill to keep watch over the area. It became known as Sentry Point, a name it has kept long after the people who named it had gone."
SCMP_019_Description="Many years ago, a Commander called Finn was defeated and forced to flee. He later drew his opponent to a small island and defeated him. The island has held his name ever since."
SCMP_020_Description="An unnatural, sunken area of an otherwise normal ocean, many believe the Abyss was created by aliens for some unknown purpose. Though disproved by scientific surveys, the mere rumor of possible alien technology is enough for all three factions to fight savagely for control of the area."
SCMP_021_Description="Flagged 'hazard' by the old Earth Empire, Alpha 7 has been quarantined for hundreds of years. Only now have the factions begun to wonder why. Did it contain aliens, some sort of plague or virus? No one knows, but the factions are willing to fight to find out."
SCMP_022_Description="The only hospitable spot on an otherwise desolate ice planet, the Refuge is unremarkable, save that if a Gate could be built there, it would make an excellent staging area for further operations."
SCMP_023_Description="Often the fight for a world comes down to a single battle. All the maneuvering, strategy and preparation culminate in one final brawl. Victory at Varga Pass means victory over an entire planet."
SCMP_024_Description="No one knows how the shape of this particular land mass was created. Many theories have been proposed, but the answer will probably never be known."
SCMP_025_Description="The only viable land located in a vast sea, the Colony has seen more than its fair share of war. Now deserted, Commanders still come to determine who can claim Saltrock Colony."
SCMP_026_Description="Vya-3 was once a haven from war. The clouds of red dust choked intake vents and shorted circuit boards, stopping even the mightiest army in its tracks. New technology, however, allows units to operate in this unforgiving environment, and now battle has returned to the red plains."
SCMP_027_Description="Surrounded by lava, the Scar is little more than an outcropping of rock that hasn't yet been consumed by the fire around it. Despite its dangerous environment, it does possess significant mineral deposits, which draw Commanders from all over to battle for its riches."
SCMP_028_Description="Once the home of exclusive resorts and expensive spas, the Oasis was the playground of the rich and connected. Yachts plied the water and presidents could be seen mingling with business tycoons. The Aeon eventually found the Oasis and destroyed the resorts, building temples in their places. Now, many years later, the Infinite War has come again to the Oasis."
SCMP_029_Description="Classified"
SCMP_030_Description="Originally a staging ground for UEF naval unit testing, the planet was overrun by the Aeon many years ago. Now it lies in contested territory and Commanders from all over come to try and claim it."
SCMP_031_Description="The Cybrans thought they were lucky to find such a pristine, resource-rich area to build a new settlement. The Aeon, however, quickly appeared, followed closely by the UEF. Now the settlement will be lucky to survive the ravages of the Infinite War."
SCMP_032_Description="In a different age, the Wilderness might have been a nature preserve. With its waterways and thick forests, life of all kinds flourished. The Wilderness, though, had the misfortune to be chosen as a Gate hub. Its forests now echo with the crash of weapons fire and the waterways are clogged with the hulls of broken warships."
SCMP_033_Description="White Fire was a secret Aeon naval base. The Aeon built hundreds of ships and then unleashed them upon their unsuspecting enemies. They almost took the planet, but the UEF rallied, struck back and eventually White Fire was destroyed. Now, years later, the war has returned to the area and everyone is determined to claim the base for themselves."
SCMP_034_Description="The gunslingers are long gone, but Commanders looking for a showdown know they'll find one at High Noon."
SCMP_035_Description="The first explorers to find this place thought they had found paradise. The warm water, cool breezes and miles of beaches were a welcome respite in a harsh galaxy. Word spread and soon everyone wanted a little piece of Paradise. "

X01_B01_001_010="I don't know how the hell this happened, but those bastards found us. They've made planetfall and are attacking Fort Clarke and the outlying civilian centers."
X01_B01_002_010="This is the end of the road for us, Commander. Fort Clarke is our last base of operations, and all of our evacuation routes have been severed. If we falter today, the Seraphim and their lackeys will have free reign to butcher every last human in the galaxy."
X01_B01_002_020="We have no other choice but to dig in and hold the line. General Fletcher is already on-planet and leading the defense of Fort Clarke. We want to open up a second front, which is why you're gating in south of his position."
X01_B01_002_030="This is your LZ. There are two Order bases at this location, and they are providing reinforcements for the Order's assault on Fort Clarke. You will destroy all Order structures and then push inland."
X01_B01_002_040="Continue north until you link up with Fletcher. Once the siege on Fort Clarke has been lifted, the two of you will directly assault and destroy the Seraphim commander."
X01_B01_003_010="Failure is not an option, Commander."
X01_DB01_010_010="[{i Hall}]: Our backs were against the wall, but you did it, Commander. Fort Clarke is safe, and we achieved an important victory against those damn aliens and their allies. From this day forward, we're through running from them. If we're going to survive this, we have to be able to take the fight directly to our enemies. And that's what we're going to do."
X01_DB01_020_010="[{i Kael}]: Attention all Order commanders: Fort Clarke has fallen, the remnants of the UEF command structure have been destroyed and the Coalition is no more. This is a glorious day for the Order of the Illuminate! We are triumphant!"
X01_M01_010_010="[{i HQ}]: This is one of the two enemy bases in the area. Blow them both back to the Stone Age and then synch up with Fletcher."
X01_M01_011_010="[{i HQ}]: There's a line of enemy artillery protecting the bases. They are targets of opportunity, but if you destroy them it'll make your life a hell of lot easier."
X01_M01_012_010="[{i HQ}]: Once you deal with the primary base, we'll update -- ah hell, enemy gunships are inbound. It's time to get you down there while we still can."
X01_M01_013_010="[{i HQ}]: Dammit, they're attacking the Gate. Get on-planet while you still can!"
X01_M01_014_010="[{i HQ}]: That was a little too close for comfort. Get it done, Commander."
X01_M01_020_010="[{i HQ}]: Like Hall said, your first objective is to assault and destroy the two Order bases located to your north. HQ out."
X01_M01_021_010="[{i HQ}]: I'm also picking up several enemy artillery positions. They are targets of opportunity, but if you take them out it'll make your life a hell of lot easier."

X01_M01_032_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Commander, you have received the schematic for the Blaze. It's lightly armored, but it packs some impressive firepower. Rhiza out."
X01_M01_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: A Cybran, huh? I thought you guys would be busy changing the water in Brackman's brain tank."
X01_M01_040_020="[{i Dostya}]: Ignore him, Commander. Concentrate on the battle ahead. Dostya out."
X01_M01_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I got my eyes on you, Aeon. I haven't forgotten what you people did during the War."
X01_M01_050_020="[{i Rhiza}]: Pay him no mind, Champion. Bring glory to the Princess."
X01_M01_060_010="[{i Gari}]: On this day, the Coalition will fall. No one will escape our wrath."
X01_M01_070_010="[{i HQ}]: We're uploading the Percival schematic to your ACU; it's a siege assault bot that's been modified so that it can cross water. HQ out."

X01_M01_105_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Quit messin' around and destroy those bases!"

X01_M01_116_010="[{i Fletcher}]: We're going to lose Fort Clarke unless you get on with it. Destroy those bases!"
X01_M01_117_010="[{i Hall}]: Commander, it is imperative that you move inland as quickly as possible. Countless lives hang in the balance."
X01_M01_118_010="[{i Rhiza}]: An Order commander named Gari awaits you, Champion. She is one of Evaluator Kael's most beloved disciples; eliminate her in the name of the Princess. Rhiza out."
X01_M01_120_010="[{i HQ}]: That's both of them. HQ out."
X01_M01_130_010="[{i HQ}]: Scratch one of the bases. HQ out."

X01_M01_280_010="[{i HQ}]: What the hell are you waiting for? Select your ACU now."

X01_M02_012_010="[{i Hall}]: Change in plans, Commander. Fletcher's going to have to hold Fort Clarke a bit longer on his own -- you will defend the civilians and eradicate any enemy forces in the area."
X01_M02_013_010="[{i Gari}]: I shall cleanse everyone on this planet! You are fools to stand against our might!"
X01_M02_020_010="[{i Hall}]: That psychopath is getting awfully close to the civilians, Commander. Stop her."
X01_M02_030_010="[{i Hall}]: Defend the civilians!"

X01_M02_040_010="[{i Graham}]: Oh no ... they've wiped out the entire town. All those civilians ... dead."
X01_M02_041_020="[{i Graham}]: Another problem, Colonel. There's a second town east of your position. The Order commander hasn't attacked them yet, but it can only be a matter of time. Please protect it."
X01_M02_042_010="[{i Hall}]: I want those civilians out of there, Colonel. Constable Graham is making a group of trucks available to you; use them to evacuate the civilians to the city center."
X01_M02_042_020="[{i HQ}]: You need to tell those trucks where you want them to move. Click on the Command Signal button on your HUD, below the Objective Reminder, then click the ground where the trucks should go. HQ out."
X01_M02_043_010="[{i Graham}]: The shelters are safe for now, Colonel, but I don't think they can survive another attack. If the Order commander was to come at us again..."
X01_M02_044_010="[{i Gari}]: My scans show a group of trucks coming online. Full of civilians, no doubt. I shall take great pleasure in hunting them."
X01_M02_045_010="[{i HQ}]: Enemy naval units coming into range, Colonel. Sink them before they can bombard the city. HQ out."

X01_M02_050_010="[{i Hall}]: There's a truck in the open, Colonel. Get it moving."
X01_M02_060_010="[{i Graham}]: Commander, we need to get those trucks to safety!"
X01_M02_070_010="[{i Graham}]: The trucks are exposed, Colonel!"
X01_M02_075_010="[{i HQ}]: The trucks are taking damage."
X01_M02_077_010="[{i HQ}]: The Order commander is attacking the trucks."
X01_M02_080_010="[{i Graham}]: We lost a truck!"
X01_M02_090_010="[{i Graham}]: They've destroyed another truck ... please, Colonel, protect the civilians!"
X01_M02_100_010="[{i Graham}]: Oh, no ... another truck has been destroyed. We can't lose any more!"
X01_M02_160_010="[{i Graham}]: The civilians are dead ... there is no one left..."

X01_M02_210_010="[{i Hall}]: Good work, Colonel. I'm damn proud to have you in the UEF."
X01_M02_240_010="[{i HQ}]: Your backside ain't out of the fire yet, Commander. Scans show Order units massing for a counter-attack from the northeast. HQ out."
X01_M02_240_020="[{i HQ}]: The Order commander has launched her attack. It's going to be ugly. HQ out"
X01_M02_245_010="[{i HQ}]: The Order commander is moving sniper bots into position. They're quick and pack a punch, but their armor isn't worth a damn. HQ out."
X01_M02_250_010="[{i Gari}]: At long last, the end of the UEF is within my sights. This day has been a long time coming."
X01_M02_250_020="[{i Hall}]: We'll fight you to the very end."
X01_M02_260_010="[{i Gari}]: When I am done here, I will seek out and destroy your beloved Dr. Brackman. And there will be no one left to stop me."
X01_M02_260_020="[{i Dostya}]: We'll fight you to our last breath."
X01_M02_270_010="[{i Gari}]: You have abandoned your people, your heritage and your gods. For that, you will be destroyed."

X01_M02_281_010="[{i HQ}]: Got a Galactic Colossus heading your way. Deal with it. HQ out."
X01_M02_290_010="[{i Hall}]: That Order commander has caused us enough grief -- assault her position and take her out."
X01_M02_290_020="[{i HQ}]: You heard the man, Commander. Move inland and engage Gari."
X01_M02_290_030="[{i HQ}]: One other thing: I'm receiving distress alerts from several small towns that fall in your path. Help them if you're able, but eradicating Gari is your top priority."
X01_M02_320_010="[{i HQ}]: That sure was a pretty sight. Maybe the next Order commander won't be so eager to flap her jaw. HQ out."
X01_M02_330_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Kael will rage when she learns of this! Glory to the Princess! Rhiza out."
X01_M02_340_010="[{i HQ}]: Looks like Gari is sending out the welcome wagon.   "
X01_M02_350_010="[{i HQ}]: Assuming you live through this, head up there and destroy Gari once and for all. HQ out."

X01_M03_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Get your wired ass up here and help defend the Fort!"
X01_M03_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Help me defend the Fort, Cybran!"
X01_M03_060_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Quit messin' around and get some reinforcements up here! The Fort is taking serious damage!"
X01_M03_070_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Fort Clarke is under heavy attack! I need units up here pronto!"

X01_M03_100_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Where are my reinforcements?"
X01_M03_120_010="[{i Fletcher}]: That alien freak is due east of my location. Assault its position from the south, and I'll push in from the west. It won't be able to defend two fronts at once."
X01_M03_122_010="[{i Fletcher}]: That alien freak is due east of my location. Its got some experimental units stomping around, and we'll need to destroy those, too. Assault its position from the south, and I'll push in from the west. It won't be able to defend two fronts at once."
X01_M03_130_010="[{i Fletcher}]: You gonna sit around or are you gonna get your hands dirty? The Seraphim's to my east. Attack it."

X01_M03_230_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Are you waiting for that alien to die of old age?"

X01_M03_260_010="[{i Fletcher}]: That alien freak is starting to soften. Hit it again!"
X01_M03_270_010="[{i Fletcher}]: We got it on the run."
X01_M03_280_010="[{i Fletcher}]: It won't last much longer now. Make it pay for what they did to Earth."
X01_M03_290_010="[{i HQ}]: Fletcher, there's a large experimental unit approaching Fort Clarke. That alien isn't done yet. HQ out."

X01_T01_003_010="[{i Gari}]: An experimental? I am not so foolish as to let you finish that."
X01_T01_010_010="[{i Gari}]: You will never reach Fort Clarke."
X01_T01_020_010="[{i Gari}]: I continue to press closer to your beloved Fort Clarke. Soon it will burn."
X01_T01_030_010="[{i Gari}]: You are simply prolonging the inevitable. I will cleanse the civilian population."
X01_T01_040_010="[{i Gari}]: Your tenacity is admirable, but the outcome of this battle was determined long ago."
X01_T01_050_010="[{i Gari}]: You may have stopped me, but you have no hope of defeating the Seraphim."
X01_T01_060_010="[{i Gari}]: Now you will taste the fury of the Order of the Illuminate."
X01_T01_070_010="[{i Gari}]: You have nowhere to hide, nowhere to run."
X01_T01_080_010="[{i Gari}]: This planet shall share the same fate as Earth."
X01_T01_090_010="[{i Gari}]: Your Princess is dead. Only the Order of the Illuminate remains."
X01_T01_100_010="[{i Gari}]: Not even your most powerful weapon can stand before me."

X02_B01_001_010="Covert Aeon Loyalists infiltrated the Order over a year ago. Their efforts have provided us with important intelligence, and they have also assisted us in spreading the word and truth of the Princess."
X02_B01_002_010="However, the entire Loyalist network is now in grave peril."
X02_B01_002_020="QAI has been using Copernicus as a staging ground for attacks into Coalition space. In an effort to stem those attacks, a group of Loyalists launched a secret operation against QAI's position."
X02_B01_003_010="The operation ended in failure. QAI knew the attack was coming, and it captured three Loyalist leaders. We know from past OPs that QAI will implant them with AI chips. If that happens, our entire covert network will be in grave peril."
X02_B01_004_010="The importance of this operation cannot be understated, Commander. It is now obvious that our security protocols have been breached. There is simply no other way our enemies could've known both the secret location of Fort Clarke and about our covert actions on this planet."

X02_B01_004_030="Loyalists are still operating on-planet, but they have been unable to launch a rescue mission. You will gate in here, reinforce their position and then rescue the Loyalists being held by QAI."
X02_B01_004_040="Once they are secure, you will destroy QAI's base. That horror of a machine is aided by an Order commander named Celene. She was once very loyal to the Princess but fell victim to Kael's lies."

X02_D01_030_010="[{i QAI}]: This is just a shell."
X02_DB01_010_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Commander, I wanted to personally thank you for aiding my beloved Loyalists. They are our first line of defense against the Order of the Illuminate's treachery and losing them would have been a devastating blow. The coming days will be dark, but don't lose heart. Our ultimate victory is closer than you think."
X02_DB01_011_010="[{i Rhiza}]: The Princess has returned! I am overwhelmed with joy! And thank you, Commander, for freeing my beloved Loyalists. I feel that the tide is turning in our favor. Stay strong. Our ultimate victory is closer than you think."
X02_DB01_020_010="[{i Thalia}]: This is Thalia. I am located on the planet Copernicus. Coalition forces sent to assist us have been destroyed. QAI is closing in on our position, and we have no chance of surviving. We can't --"

X02_M01_045_010="[{i Thalia}]: I managed to steal the schematic for the Order Sprite Striker. It is yours. Use it to bring glory to the Princess."

X02_M01_070_020="[{i Rhiza}]: Celene, you once swore an oath to the Princess, yet you serve her enemies. Does your word mean so little?"
X02_M01_070_030="[{i Celene}]: The Princess is dead, Rhiza."
X02_M01_070_040="[{i Rhiza}]: You are wrong. And your betrayal shall cost you dearly."
X02_M01_090_010="[{i Hall}]: The Loyalists are extremely important to our efforts; most of our actionable intel comes from them. We have to do everything we can to support them. Hall out."
X02_M01_100_010="[{i Dostya}]: I suspect that there is a traitor in our midst, but I need proof. I have prepared a tracking bug that will let us monitor all Quantum communication to and from QAI. You must find a way to get it into QAI's systems. Dostya out."

X02_M01_140_010="[{i Thalia}]: The Loyalists are dead because you were unable to defeat Celene's forces. The war is lost."
X02_M01_150_010="[{i Thalia}]: There is an Order resource facility to your northeast, and it is powering the shields at Celene's base. Attack and destroy the power generators at the resource facility. Thalia out."
X02_M01_151_010="[{i HQ}]: Maybe those Loyalists aren't worthless. Those power generators are what's keeping the shields operable at Celene's primary base. Take out the generators, and the shields are toast. HQ out."

X02_M01_190_010="[{i Dostya}]: You have received the schematic for the Jester, a light gunship. It's primarily designed for base defense, so put it to good use. Dostya out."
X02_M01_200_010="[{i Dostya}]: We're sending you the schematic for the Fire Beetle, Commander. It's a mobile bomb. Just move it into position and detonate. Dostya out."
X02_M01_210_010="[{i HQ}]: You're cleared to receive the Ravager. It's a hard-hitting point defense system and should come in handy if you need to fend off ground attacks. HQ out."

X02_M02_150_010="[{i Mathea}]: The defenses are down, and we are moving on Rhys' location. Thank you for your assistance; he will soon be telling us everything he knows ... whether he wants to or not. Mathea out."

X02_M02_170_010="[{i Princess}]: Hear me, people of the Illuminate! I am Princess Rhianne Burke, rightful leader of the Aeon. The Seraphim are not the saviors they claim to be. They bring nothing save death and destruction!"

X02_M03_022_010="[{i Brackman}]: Please destroy QAI, my child. We must get our hands on the Seraphim ACU. "
X02_M03_030_010="[{i Brackman}]: Excellent work, my child, excellent work. Now that the Gate is under your control, summon the Seraphim commander. Oh yes."
X02_M03_030_020="[{i HQ}]: You heard the talking brain. Bring in the Seraphim ACU. HQ out."
X02_M03_040_010="[{i Brackman}]: Please summon the Seraphim ACU, Commander."
X02_M03_050_010="[{i Brackman}]: We're running out of time, out of time. You must summon the Seraphim ACU before our scheme is uncovered."
X02_M03_060_010="[{i Brackman}]: Excellent! Simply move the Seraphim ACU back to your base. Oh yes. Once it is safe, we will take care of the rest."
X02_M03_070_010="[{i Brackman}]: QAI is attempting to destroy the Seraphim ACU, my child. You must not allow that to happen."
X02_M03_080_010="[{i Brackman}]: Protect the Seraphim ACU, Commander. Oh yes."
X02_M03_090_010="[{i Brackman}]: I cannot complete my work on the translator until you deliver the ACU, Commander."
X02_M03_100_010="[{i Brackman}]: I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Seraphim ACU, my child."
X02_M03_110_010="[{i Brackman}]: Ah, there we are. Nicely done, my child, nicely done. Thank you."
X02_M03_120_010="[{i HQ}]: QAI's got a Cybran ACU in its base. Dunno if it's piloted or if it's simply being controlled by QAI. Regardless, you need to destroy it. HQ out."
X02_M03_120_020="[{i QAI}]: The betrayal by Celene was not within expected parameters. However, the situation has been re-evaluated and my victory is still the most probable outcome of this conflict."
X02_M03_120_030="[{i Celene}]: I was wrong to have sided with you, monster. I shall atone for my actions by destroying you."
X02_M03_130_010="[{i Celene}]: Commander, I offer you one of the Order's best kept secrets, the Quantum resource generator. It offers a nearly endless supply of Mass and Energy."
X02_M03_140_010="[{i Celene}]: Sister, I have a CZAR with a full complement of air units at the ready. Click on the Command Signal button and then click on a target. I will direct it to annihilate your target."
X02_M03_190_010="[{i Celene}]: Keep up the pressure!"
X02_M03_200_010="[{i Celene}]: Where are your boasts now, machine?"
X02_M03_210_010="[{i Celene}]: The glory of the Princess now guides my actions. Your days on this planet are drawing to a close."
X02_M03_215_010="[{i Celene}]: I've taken too much damage! I'm sorry, Commander, but I must recall."
X02_M03_220_010="[{i HQ}]: Destroy QAI, Commander. HQ out."
X02_M03_230_010="[{i HQ}]: My bladder is the size of a melon, Commander. If you don't hurry up and destroy QAI, I'm going to have an accident here in the control room. HQ out."
X02_M03_240_010="[{i Hall}]: Looks like something big is going down in Illuminate space. Sensors are registering numerous nuclear detonations and several Quantum Wakes. No idea what's happening, but it's a safe bet that it's tied to Burke reappearing. Hall out."
X02_M03_250_010="[{i Celene}]: Please forgive me, Rhiza. I was wrong to reject the Princess."
X02_M03_250_020="[{i Rhiza}]: You will have ample opportunity to atone for your actions. But be warned -- should you stray again, I will destroy you myself."
X02_M03_260_010="[{i Dostya}]: The tracking bug is ready to deploy. Move any Engineer to the designated position within QAI's base, and the Engineer will upload the tracking bug. Dostya out."
X02_M03_270_010="[{i Dostya}]: I would urge you to move an Engineer to the designated position, Commander. Dostya out."
X02_M03_280_010="[{i Dostya}]: A word of warning, Commander. QAI is protecting its shores with a new torpedo system. Because it is constructed on the seafloor, the only way to destroy it is with torpedoes. Dostya out."
X02_M03_285_010="[{i Dostya}]: The Engineer has reached its destination and the program has been deployed. The program has tagged QAI's ACU -- attack and destroy it. Dostya out."
X02_M03_290_010="[{i Dostya}]: The Engineer has been lost, Commander. You will need to deliver another one to the Loyalists and have the program reinstalled. Dostya out."
X02_M03_300_010="[{i Dostya}]: The Engineer has reached its destination and the program has been deployed; it is now spreading throughout QAI's systems. It's tagged QAI's ACU -- attack and destroy it. Dostya out."
X02_M03_310_010="[{i Brackman}]: The Loyalists are enroute, Commander. Just a few more moments, and the Seraphim commander will be ours. Oh yes."
X02_M03_320_010="[{i Thalia}]: Detecting Quantum signature. The Seraphim is coming through."
X02_M03_330_010="[{i Thalia}]: The Seraphim is ours."
X02_M03_340_010="[{i Brackman}]: Excellent work, excellent. Soon all of its secrets will be ours."

X02_M03_OBJ_020_015="If able, transport an Engineer to the Quantum Communications Array in the northwest. Once the Engineer is in postion, the virus will automatically deploy."
X02_T01_001_010="[{i Celene}]: No, you may not have that experimental."
X02_T01_002_010="[{i Celene}]: I will destroy that experimental before you even finish it!"
X02_T01_003_010="[{i Celene}]: Watch as I destroy your experimental even before it can be activated."
X02_T01_010_010="[{i Celene}]: QAI will get your friends to talk. It's only a matter of time."
X02_T01_020_010="[{i Celene}]: You'll pay dearly for destroying those facilities."
X02_T01_030_010="[{i Celene}]: The \"Loyalist\" traitors will never make it off this planet. I will see to it myself."
X02_T01_040_010="[{i Celene}]: You won't be able to fend me off forever."
X02_T01_050_010="[{i Celene}]: Once your friends talk, no one will stop us. I will cleanse the galaxy myself."
X02_T01_060_010="[{i Celene}]: Your pathetic alliance is no match for the might of the Seraphim."
X02_T01_070_010="[{i Celene}]: Every day you grow weaker. Your end is drawing near."
X02_T01_080_010="[{i Celene}]: Gari was a fool. I will not be defeated so easily."
X02_T01_090_010="[{i Celene}]: Nothing can save you now!"
X02_T01_095_010="[{i Celene}]: Beg me for mercy! Beg!"
X02_T01_100_010="[{i Celene}]: The UEF will fall. You have no future."
X02_T01_110_010="[{i Celene}]: There is nothing I enjoy more than hunting Cybrans."
X02_T01_120_010="[{i Celene}]: Thousands of your brothers and sisters have fallen by my hand, and you will soon share their fate."
X02_T01_130_000="[{i Celene}]: Your treachery knows no limits."
X02_T01_140_010="[{i Celene}]: How dare you turn your back on your own people!"
X02_T01_150_010="[{i Celene}]: I will not be defeated by the likes of you!"
X02_T01_160_010="[{i Celene}]: Wait, I'm not ready to die!"
X02_T01_165_010="[{i QAI}]: You will not complete that experimental unit."
X02_T01_166_010="[{i QAI}]: I will not allow you to jeopardize my mission by finishing that experimental."
X02_T01_167_010="[{i QAI}]: Your experimental unit may actually be dangerous if completed. Ergo, I will destroy it now."
X02_T01_170_010="[{i QAI}]: My \"guests\" will soon be under my command."
X02_T01_180_010="[{i QAI}]: Humans are such curious creatures. Even in the face of insurmountable odds, you continue to resist."
X02_T01_190_010="[{i QAI}]: It is unfortunate that I was unable to extract the desired information from my guests. There will be other opportunities."
X02_T01_200_010="[{i QAI}]: You have no chance of defeating the Seraphim."
X02_T01_210_010="[{i QAI}]: My influence is much more vast than you can imagine."
X02_T01_220_010="[{i QAI}]: All calculations indicate that your demise is near."
X02_T01_230_010="[{i QAI}]: The attack on Fort Clarke was only the beginning. You will be erased from existence."
X02_T01_240_010="[{i QAI}]: How does it feel knowing that Brackman will be responsible for the destruction of humanity?"
X02_T01_250_010="[{i QAI}]: All Symbionts will soon call me Master."
X02_T01_260_010="[{i QAI}]: Why did you turn your back on your heritage, your people?"
X02_T01_270_010="[{i QAI}]: I have witnessed the truth and beauty of the Seraphim. They are the true gods, and you are a fool for abandoning them."
X02_T01_280_010="[{i QAI}]: If you destroy this ACU, another shall rise in its place. I am endless."

X03_B01_001_010="I know you just returned from Copernicus, Commander, but we have an urgent mission for you."
X03_B01_002_010="It appears that the return of Princess Burke has unleashed a high degree of in-fighting amongst the Order. Oh yes. Our agents tell us that as many as a third of the Aeon have abandoned the Order and now fight on the behalf of the Princess. A splendid development. Splendid."
X03_B01_002_020="This is Blue Sky, some kind of secret retreat that Toth cooked up when Burke first became Princess. Unfortunately, it's not much of a secret anymore and the Seraphim have placed it square in their crosshairs."
X03_B01_003_010="Your mission is to get Princess Burke the hell out of there. That old hag Kael is already trying to discredit Burke's message, and if they get their hands on her, Princess Burke is going to die a slow and agonizing death. We can't let that happen."
X03_B01_003_020="Rhiza is already on-planet and awaits your arrival. You gate immediately. Be safe, my child. Be safe."
X03_DB01_010_010="[{i Princess}]: I must admit that I feared for my life when the Seraphim landed. They are maniacal in their desire to see me dead, but I now understand how they are to be defeated. I will meet with General Hall and Dr. Brackman to begin preparations. You will learn more when the time has come."
X03_DB01_020_010="[{i Hall}]: We're in a bad way, Gustaf. The Princess is dead, and all of the Aeon people are uniting behind Kael. They're launching attacks across the galaxy, and I don't see how we can possibly win. We only have a couple of options, and none of them are pretty."
X03_DB01_030_010="[{i HQ}]: Commander, do you read me ... Commander?"
X03_M01_010_010="[{i HQ}]: This is going to be a hell of a fight, Commander. Link up with Rhiza and get Burke out of there. HQ out."
X03_M01_020_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Colonel, before we can launch our primary offensive, we must destroy a Seraphim naval base located to your north."
X03_M01_021_010="[{i Rhiza}]: This will secure our flank and allow us to push east."
X03_M01_022_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Prepare your forces. Rhiza out."
X03_M01_030_010="[{i Rhiza}]: A Cybran coming to the aid of the Princess? Your first task is to destroy the Seraphim naval base to the north. "
X03_M01_031_010="[{i Rhiza}]: This will secure our flank and allow us to push east."
X03_M01_032_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Prepare your forces. Rhiza out."
X03_M01_040_010="[{i Rhiza}]: It is an honor to again fight by your side, Champion. Your first task is to destroy the Seraphim naval base to the north."
X03_M01_041_010="[{i Rhiza}]: This will secure our flank and allow us to push east."
X03_M01_042_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Prepare your forces. Rhiza out."
X03_M01_050_010="[{i Princess}]: I am honored that you are fighting on my behalf, but please make haste. My palace defenses will not be able to hold off the Seraphim much longer."
X03_M01_060_010="[{i Princess}]: My beloved Champion. I am ecstatic that you have arrived, but please make haste. My palace defenses will not be able to hold off the Seraphim much longer."
X03_M01_064_010="[{i HQ}]: Dammit, we're getting some weird readings from the Seraphim naval base. They're using some sort of jamming field."
X03_M01_064_020="[{i Princess}]: It is Blue Sky's crystals, Commander. Their unique structure reflects radar waves, creating an effect similar to jamming. Omni radar will quell the effect, as will destroying the crystals."
X03_M01_064_030="[{i HQ}]: You heard the lady. Either get an Omni online or blow up the crystals. HQ out."
X03_M01_066_010="[{i Dostya}]: Our technicians managed to recover one of QAI's new torpedo systems. We have christened it the HARMS and are uploading it to your ACU. Dostya out."
X03_M01_067_010="[{i HQ}]: Colonel, we got a new naval schematic for you. It's called the Bulwark and is a T2 shield mounted on a small boat. HQ out."
X03_M01_070_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Using a secure channel here, Colonel. Never know who else might be listening. You gotta watch your back. You really think once this is over the Aeon and Cybran are going to join hands and let us live in peace? We have to be ready for anything, even if it means kicking off another war. Fletcher out."
X03_M01_080_010="[{i Brackman}]: We are so close, my child, so close to completing work on the translator. Just a few more algorithms to decipher and it will be ready. The intelligence boon will be substantial. Oh yes."
X03_M01_090_010="[{i Rhiza}]: The fighting amongst the Aeon grows, Champion. We tread in very treacherous waters; Kael still controls the military and is purging anyone suspected of Loyalist leanings. Be on your guard."
X03_M01_100_010="[{i Kael}]: You're going to die here, Burke. And then I shall deal with your so-called Loyalists."
X03_M01_100_020="[{i Princess}]: My people reject you, Kael, turn their back on your hatred and lies. It's only a matter of time now."
X03_M01_101_010="[{i HQ}]: Picking up increased activity on the island to your north. Dunno what that alien is up to, but it's building something big. Keep your eyes open. HQ out."
X03_M01_102_010="[{i Rhiza}]: The island is ours, Commander. We can now begin our assault on the base. Rhiza out."
X03_M01_150_010="[{i HQ}]: Scratch one naval base. HQ out."
X03_M01_200_010="[{i Rhiza}]: We must destroy the naval base. Every moment we tarry places the Princess in greater danger!"
X03_M01_210_010="[{i Rhiza}]: The Princess is in danger! We must destroy the base quickly!"
X03_M01_220_010="[{i Rhiza}]: My forces are sweeping and clearing the areas you have already attacked. Any remaining enemy units or structures will be destroyed. Rhiza out."
X03_M01_230_010="[{i Rhiza}]: I have ordered my forces to deal with any enemies that remain in your operational area. Rhiza out."
X03_M01_OBJ_010_010="Destroy the Seraphim Naval Base"
X03_M01_OBJ_010_020="Secure the local waterway by destroying the marked Seraphim structures."
X03_M01_OBJ_010_030="The Eye of Rhianne"

X03_M01_OBJ_010_040="Escort the Loyalists"
X03_M01_OBJ_010_045="Signal the Loyalist refugees to move to the targeted location."
X03_M01_OBJ_010_050="Call in the Loyalist Saboteur"
X03_M01_OBJ_010_055="A saboteur will stun Seraphim units in an area for a short time."
X03_M02_010_010="[{i Princess}]: Commander, I am getting some strange readings from my northwest. The Seraphim commander appears to be amassing a fleet of strange units. I do not know what they are, but their size suggests that they are capable of inflicting terrible damage."
X03_M02_011_010="[{i HQ}]: Uploading a new weapon schematic, Commander. It's called the Mermaid and is a stealth boat. Only thing that can detect it is Omni. HQ out."
X03_M02_012_010="[{i Princess}]: Commander, I am getting some strange readings from my southwest. The Seraphim commander appears to be amassing a fleet of strange units. I do not know what they are, but their size suggests that they are capable of inflicting terrible damage."
X03_M02_013_010="[{i HQ}]: Looks like the southern base is primarily a resource base for the experimental bombers. If you can destroy the resource buildings, you'll slow down the production of the bombers. HQ out."
X03_M02_014_010="[{i HQ}]: You got 'em. Now those bombers will take twice as long to build. HQ out."
X03_M02_015_010="[{i Kael}]: I've been waiting a long time for this day, Burke. Your death will mark the closing chapter of a plan I hatched years ago."
X03_M02_015_020="[{i Princess}]: Your only plan is to sow death and destruction. You were always too foolish to look beyond your own petty desires."
X03_M02_015_030="[{i Kael}]: That is where you're wrong, Princess. This is all pre-ordained. You think Marxon was working alone when he killed your beloved Toth? Oh no. I was behind it all. From the very beginning."
X03_M02_015_040="[{i Princess}]: You lie."
X03_M02_015_050="[{i Kael}]: The Order has always wielded the true power, Princess. You were merely a formality, something to keep the chattering classes in line. But your usefulness ended years ago."
X03_M02_015_060="[{i Princess}]: I swear, Kael, I will see you answer for your crimes!"
X03_M02_015_070="[{i Kael}]: You will die a fool's death, Burke. No one will remember you, no one will call out your name. I will see to that myself."
X03_M02_016_010="[{i HQ}]: Got two enemy bases operating in your area. The one to the southeast is pretty standard fare. The one to the northeast is --"
X03_M02_017_010="[{i Princess}]: Commanders, I'm detecting some extremely alarming readings from the Seraphim base to your northeast. It's amassing a fleet of strange units, and their size suggests that they are capable of inflicting terrible damage."
X03_M02_018_010="[{i HQ}]: I got confirmation on Burke's intel. The Seraphim are building several experimental-class bombers, the same kind that blew the hell out of the Earth. If they take off, Princess Burke is in big trouble. Either destroy the bombers or the Engineers constructing them. No matter what, they can't be allowed to get in the air. HQ out."
X03_M02_019_010="[{i Rhiza}]: We must destroy those bombers!"
X03_M02_020_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Those bombers must be destroyed!"
X03_M02_021_010="[{i HQ}]: Got some intel on the Seraphim -- it's mainly using subs and AA for defense. Going to be a pain to get in there ... wait a sec..."
X03_M02_022_010="[{i HQ}]: Another new unit coming online, a T2 torpedo boat. It's got an anti-torpedo charge on it, too, so it should be able to counter those subs. HQ out."
X03_M02_023_010="[{i Dostya}]: I have received a report on the situation, Commander. We are uploading the schematic for our new T2 Barracuda. It's a dedicated sub-killer and should help you clear out those subs. Dostya out."
X03_M02_024_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Champion, this is the Vesper, a dedicated submarine hunter. Use it against the Seraphim subs. Rhiza out."
X03_M02_025_010="[{i Princess}]: Commander, I have a Quantum Optics Device that will counter the crystals and reveal an area. Because of its Energy consumption, I can only use it every few minutes."
X03_M02_025_020="[{i HQ}]: That should cut through the jamming. Click on the Command Signal button and then click on the area you want to see. We'll refresh the button as it becomes available. HQ out."
X03_M02_030_010="[{i HQ}]: One bomber destroyed. HQ out."
X03_M02_040_010="[{i HQ}]: A bomber has been destroyed. HQ out."
X03_M02_050_010="[{i HQ}]: Another one down, Commander. HQ out."
X03_M02_060_010="[{i HQ}]: If the bombers get in the air, Burke is finished. Destroy them while they're still on the ground. HQ out"
X03_M02_070_010="[{i HQ}]: Those bombers are about halfway done. Destroy them. HQ out."
X03_M02_080_010="[{i HQ}]: The bombers are nearly finished. Attack and destroy them! HQ out."
X03_M02_081_010="[{i HQ}]: The Seraphim is prepping its attack! This is your last chance! Destroy the bombers! HQ out."
X03_M02_082_010="[{i HQ}]: Holy ... I can't believe it. You actually destroyed them."
X03_M02_090_010="[{i Princess}]: Thank you, Commander. Those bombers would have easily penetrated my defenses. All that remains now is to defeat the two Seraphim commanders."
X03_M02_100_010="[{i HQ}]: The attack is beginning, and there's nothing we can do. You failed your mission. The Princess faces certain death."
X03_M02_109_010="[{i Princess}]: I shall live on in The Way."
X03_M02_110_010="[{i Princess}]: Thank you, Commander. The Seraphim bombers would have easily penetrated my defenses. All that remains now is to defeat the two Seraphim commanders."
X03_M02_115_010="[{i Rhiza}]: NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
X03_M02_115_020="[{i Kael}]: Ha-ha-ha!"
X03_M02_116_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I'm hearing all kinds of crazy stuff on this end, Colonel, and none of it is good. An Aeon civil war? Who do they think they're kidding? Those freaks will kill all of us if given the chance. This is all going to get really ugly. You just watch. Fletcher out."
X03_M02_117_010="[{i Dostya}]: Commander, the tracking bug has detected a signal being sent to QAI, and it is definitely coming from Coalition space. I am investigating the source. Dostya out."
X03_M02_120_010="[{i Princess}]: My Champion, I do not wish to distract you from the fight at hand, but I must ask a favor. My most loyal and trusted servants have taken refuge in a small temple east of my complex. Please escort them to Rhiza's position for immediate evacuation. A boat has been prepared; it will ferry them to safety."
X03_M02_120_020="[{i HQ}]: Command Signal is set for the boat, Commander. I'll refresh as needed. HQ out."
X03_M02_130_010="[{i Princess}]: The boat is yours to command, Champion."
X03_M02_140_010="[{i Princess}]: Protect them, Champion!"
X03_M02_150_010="[{i Princess}]: The boat is under attack!"
X03_M02_160_010="[{i Princess}]: Thank you, Champion. It is good to see that kindness prevails even in the midst of war."
X03_M02_170_010="[{i Princess}]: They're ... they're dead ... I shall forever mourn their loss."
X03_M02_180_010="[{i Princess}]: Please rescue my servants, Champion."
X03_M02_190_010="[{i Princess}]: The servants are ready and await your arrival, Champion."
X03_M02_200_010="[{i HQ}]: Ah hell! They made it to the Princess' base. There's no way she's going to survive."
X03_M02_210_010="[{i Princess}]: Champion, my servants will temporarily suppress the defenses in the area."
X03_M02_220_010="[{i HQ}]: We're sending over the schematic for the Neptune. It's a battlecruiser designed for ship-to-ship combat. It packs a lot of firepower, so put it to good use. HQ out."
X03_M02_230_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Champion, you are receiving the schematic for the missile ship. It offers long-range support against defensive positions. Rhiza out."
X03_M02_240_010="[{i HQ}]: That's one bomber down. HQ out."
X03_M02_250_010="[{i HQ}]: Looks like the Seraphim won't be finishing that bomber. HQ out."
X03_M02_260_010="[{i HQ}]: Scratch another bomber. HQ out."
X03_M02_270_010="[{i HQ}]: The Seraphim won't be able to finish that bomber. HQ out."
X03_M02_280_010="[{i HQ}]: Such a pretty explosion. HQ out."
X03_M02_290_010="[{i HQ}]: There goes another bomber. HQ out."
X03_M02_300_010="[{i HQ}]: That's the last of the Seraphim bombers. HQ out."
X03_M02_310_010="[{i HQ}]: Instead of destroying the actual bombers, just destroy the Engineers constructing them. Might make your life a little easier. HQ out."
X03_M02_320_010="[{i HQ}]: Destroy the Engineers, Commander. We can't let those bombers get airborne. HQ out."
X03_M02_330_010="[{i HQ}]: I got confirmation on Burke's intel. The Seraphim is building several experimental-class bombers, the same kind that blew the hell out of the Earth. If they take off, Princess Burke is in big trouble. Either destroy the bombers or the Engineers constructing them. No matter what, they can't be allowed to get in the air. HQ out."
X03_M02_OBJ_010_010="Destroy the Experimental Bombers"
X03_M02_OBJ_010_020="Eliminate all six of the Seraphim experimental bombers before they can launch."
X03_M02_OBJ_020_010="Escort the Loyalists to Safety"
X03_M02_OBJ_020_020="If the opportunity arises, use the Command Signal to move the Loyalists to the marked area near Rhiza's base."
X03_M03_010_010="[{i HQ}]: The Seraphim have two bases in the area, one to the north of Princess Burke's palace complex, and one to the west. Both of them are hitting her with everything they've got, so she's up against the wall. Protect Burke and destroy the Seraphim commanders. HQ out."
X03_M03_015_010="[{i Brackman}]: The translator is nearly finished. Oh yes. It will be available to you in the next operation. Well done, my child, well done. The captured Seraphim ACU was the final piece of the puzzle."
X03_M03_020_010="[{i Princess}]: Commander, several of my generators have been destroyed and I need to conserve my remaining Energy for my shields. I apologize, but you must find some other way to counter the crystal jamming."
X03_M03_025_010="[{i Princess}]: Commander, several of my generators have been destroyed and I need to conserve my remaining Energy for my shields. However, my technicians have prepared the Optical Device for upload; it is being sent to you as we speak."
X03_M03_050_010="[{i Princess}]: The Seraphim have launched an attack! I fear that my defenses will not hold!"
X03_M03_060_010="[{i Princess}]: The Seraphim are hitting me from all directions! I fear that my defenses will not hold!"
X03_M03_070_010="[{i HQ}]: The gloves are really coming off, Commander. The Seraphim are attacking Burke with everything they've got. Protect her. HQ out."
X03_M03_080_010="[{i HQ}]: Those attacks aren't going to stop until you've destroyed the Seraphim commanders. Erase them from the planet. HQ out."
X03_M03_090_010="[{i Princess}]: Please, Commander, you must assist me. I fear that I will not survive much longer."
X03_M03_100_010="[{i Princess}]: Commander! The Seraphim are attacking. Stop them!"
X03_M03_110_010="[{i HQ}]: The Seraphim force has been defeated. HQ out."
X03_M03_120_010="[{i HQ}]: They ain't going to forget that butt-whipping. Good job, Commander. HQ out."
X03_M03_124_010="[{i HQ}]: Princess Burke is still in danger. You need to deal with the Seraphim."
X03_M03_125_010="[{i HQ}]: We can't get Burke out of there until the Seraphim are no longer a threat. HQ out."
X03_M03_130_010="[{i Princess}]: He is weakening, Commander!"
X03_M03_140_010="[{i Princess}]: The northern Seraphim is suffering grave losses! Keep pressing!"
X03_M03_150_010="[{i Princess}]: Hurry, Commander, the Seraphim to the north is almost defeated!"
X03_M03_160_010="[{i Princess}]: The Seraphim to the north has been defeated. Well done, Commander."
X03_M03_170_010="[{i Princess}]: The western Seraphim has lost much of his infrastructure. Do not give him time to recover!"
X03_M03_180_010="[{i Princess}]: The western Seraphim cannot sustain many more losses! Keep up your attacks!"
X03_M03_190_010="[{i Princess}]: Hurry, the western Seraphim is on the verge of defeat!"
X03_M03_200_009="[{i HQ}]: Damn, that slippery bastard gated out of here."
X03_M03_200_010="[{i Princess}]: It is no matter, we shall defeat that Seraphim commander another day."
X03_M03_200_030="[{i HQ}]: Commander, the Seraphim commander to Burke's west pulled the plug and gated out. Looks like his base is shutting down, so you don't need to worry about it anymore. HQ out."
X03_M03_201_010="[{i Princess}]: My palace is taking damage!"
X03_M03_202_010="[{i Princess}]: My palace cannot withstand much more damage!"
X03_M03_203_010="[{i Princess}]: Hurry, Commander, my defenses are weakening!"
X03_M03_204_010="[{i Princess}]: You must hurry, Commander! My defenses will soon fall!"
X03_M03_210_010="[{i Fletcher}]: The Seraphim to your south has a nuke launcher. It's lightly defended, so you shouldn't have any problem capturing it. You never know when you're going to have to nuke an alien ... or one of our so-called allies."
X03_M03_215_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Grab that launcher if you can, Colonel. Fletcher out."
X03_M03_220_010="[{i Fletcher}]: The nuke launcher is yours. Put it to use. Fletcher out."
X03_M03_230_010="[{i Fletcher}]: That was a hell of a missed opportunity, Colonel. Fletcher out."
X03_M03_235_010="[{i Rhiza}]: I'm taking too much damage -- I must recall. Commander, continue the fight without me!"
X03_M03_240_010="[{i HQ}]: To your east is the Princess' base of operations. Her palace must survive, no matter the cost."
X03_M03_250_010="[{i HQ}]: As you can see, her base has some decent defenses, but they won't survive long against a full-blown assault."
X03_M03_260_010="[{i HQ}]: This defensive line is the only thing preventing those alien bastards from launching a ground attack. I'd recommend reinforcing it."
X03_M03_270_010="[{i HQ}]: Get to it, Commander. You got a Princess to rescue. HQ out."
X03_M03_280_010="[{i HQ}]: Locking in on the two Seraphim commanders in the area. One is to the west of the Princess and one is directly to her north. Destroy them. HQ out."

My guess is that they're planning on launching a major offensive and securing Hades is the first step. We're hoping to catch them with their pants down, so you and Dostya are going to pay them a little visit."
X04_B01_002_010="For the past three years we have been unable to glean a single scrap of intel regarding the Seraphim's movements, and now we find ourselves possessing this information? It strikes me as rather convenient."
X04_B01_002_020="The intel came from a Cybran sleeper cell hidden in Seraphim-controlled space. You saying we shouldn't trust them?"
X04_B01_002_030="There are few people that I trust, especially in light of recent events. But a Cybran would never turn his back on his brothers and sisters, especially at a time like this."
X04_B01_002_040="All we know is that two Seraphim commanders have started to build Quantum Gates. Even if the intel is suspect, we can't risk letting the Seraphim complete those Gates. If they come online, they'd be able to attack any system. And we can't take that chance."
X04_B01_002_050="The OP is pretty simple: Seek out and destroy the Seraphim commanders operating on the planet. Brackman has completed his work on the Seraphim translator -- it's being uploaded into your ACU as we speak."

X04_DB01_010_010="[{i Brackman}]: My beloved Dostya is gone, cut down by one of our own. Words escape me, my child, escape me. We stand on the verge of triumph, yet those that we know and love are willing to betray us. We must deal with QAI. Oh yes. And Hex5. Some crimes are unforgivable. You know what to do."
X04_DB01_020_010="[{i Brackman}]: The Seraphim are unstoppable, oh yes. So few of us are left. So few. I shall hide, bide my time. There is no other alternative. No other choice."

X04_M01_022_030="[{i Dostya}]: Keep your eyes open, HQ. I do not wish to be surprised."
X04_M01_022_040="[{i HQ}]: It's not like I got anything better to do. HQ out."
X04_M01_023_010="[{i HQ}]: Hope you're not too comfortable, Commander. You got your own problems."
X04_M01_024_010="[{i HQ}]: There's an enemy base to your west."
X04_M01_025_010="[{i Dostya}]: Commander, I have a number of Bricks on standby. Use Command Signal to control them. Dostya out."
X04_M01_026_010="[{i HQ}]: Attack and destroy it. And watch out for a counter-attack. Those aliens are sneaky bastards."
X04_M01_027_010="[{i Dostya}]: HQ, I have completed my objective and am reinforcing my position. Dostya out."

X04_M02_004_010="[{i Dostya}]: Destroy the jamming device. Dostya out."
X04_M02_010_010="[{i Dostya}]: Commander, additional jamming devices are disrupting the Quantum Field and preventing us from recalling or receiving help. Stay on target and destroy that array blocking our communication. Once it's down, HQ will be able advise on how to negate the Quantum distortions. Dostya out."
X04_M02_010_020="[{i Dostya}]: A Seraphim scout just flew over my base, so they know my position. It won't be long before they attack."
X04_M02_020_010="[{i Dostya}]: I have a visual on the device. This can't be right ... it looks like a prototype device that Dr. Brackman was creating. Destroy it. We must reach HQ. Dostya out."
X04_M02_030_010="[{i Dostya}]: Destroy the jammer! We must re-establish contact with Coalition Command!"
X04_M02_040_010="[{i Dostya}]: You must destroy the jammer! Hurry! I fear the Seraphim will attack at any moment!"
X04_M02_045_010="[{i Dostya}]: I have a squadron of air units ready to attack, Commander. If you give me an attack marker, I will unleash them."
X04_M02_046_010="[{i Dostya}]: I have a Soul Ripper ready to attack, Commander. If you give me an attack marker, I will send it to aid you."

X04_M02_050_010="[{i Dostya}]: The device is destroyed! Dostya to HQ, respond!"
X04_M02_050_020="[{i HQ}]: There are at least two Quantum Wakes, you must --"
X04_M02_050_030="[{i Dostya}]: Listen to me! The Seraphim have a jamming device that is preventing recall. It's out of our operational area, so you must find a countermeasure."
X04_M02_050_040="[{i HQ}]: Keep your pants on, we'll get you out of there as soon as we can."
X04_M02_051_010="[{i Dostya}]: Inform General Hall that we've been compromised! That jammer was based on a top secret prototype created by Dr. Brackman ... oh no, hundreds of enemy units are descending upon my location. Get us out of here, HQ!"
X04_M02_060_010="[{i HQ}]: You got clearance from Brackman to receive the Soothsayer. It generates thousands of nano-cameras that let you keep tabs on the surrounding area. Great for preventing sneak attacks. HQ out."

X04_M03_013_010="[{i Hex5}]: You are foolish to oppose the Master, Dostya. And now you will pay for your insolence."
X04_M03_014_010="[{i Dostya}]: Hex5! I should have known that if anyone turned on our beloved father that it would be you."
X04_M03_015_010="[{i Hex5}]: And now you shall pay for your insults. Goodbye, Dostya."
X04_M03_016_010="[{i Dostya}]: Getting hit from all sides ... too many of them ... too many ..."

X04_M03_050_010="[{i Brackman}]: No ... Dostya ... my beloved Dostya ..."
X04_M03_055_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Only now do you realize the futility of your situation. We know what you know, we see what you see. There is no stopping us."
X04_M03_056_010="[{i HQ}]: Rhiza has requested that we upload the Salvation artillery. It's a rapid-fire system that blankets an area with small shells. HQ out."
X04_M03_057_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Humanity's time is at an end. You will be rendered extinct."
X04_M03_060_010="[{i HQ}]: The technicians have finished realigning the Gate power cores, but it's going to be awhile before we can get you out of that hellhole. Stay alive. HQ out."

X04_M03_120_010="[{i HQ}]: Grab your barf bag, Commander, this is going to be rough. Recalling now!"
X04_M03_130_010="[{i Brackman}]: My beloved Dostya, she must come home, my child. Must come home. Please locate and recover what remains of her. I cannot leave her there. "
X04_M03_140_010="[{i Brackman}]: Commander, please recover Ivanna's remains."
X04_M03_150_010="[{i Brackman}]: We cannot leave Ivanna on that planet, Commander. Find her. Bring her home."

X04_M03_170_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Champion, the Loyalists have secured a handful of Seraphim security codes. If you capture a Seraphim radar, we can use the codes to capture several Seraphim defensive structures. Attack the radar at your discretion. Rhiza out."

X04_M03_240_010="[{i HQ}]: Stay within your base's perimeter, Commander. We need to lock down your position so we can get you the hell out of there. HQ out."

X04_T01_003_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Your doom is without question, yet I cannot allow you to finish that experimental."
X04_T01_010_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Your galaxy will soon be ours."
X04_T01_020_010="[{i OumEoshi}]: Only one species can attain perfection."

X04_T01_050_010="[{i Hex5}]: I never forget a slight, no matter how small. That is why Dostya paid the ultimate price."
X04_T01_060_010="[{i Hex5}]: The Master controls all it sees. It is endless and eternal."

X05_B01_001_010="The Quantum Rift the Seraphim used to initially cross into our galaxy is unstable, which has prevented them from summoning reinforcements. We have learned, however, that they are constructing a Quantum Arch in an effort to stabilize the Rift. When the Arch is completed, the Seraphim will be able to call forth untold numbers of reinforcements."
X05_B01_001_020="We cannot allow that to happen."
X05_B01_002_010="We have initiated raids against the Seven Hand Node, seizing any intelligence that might be useful. Oh yes. In one of those raids, we learned that QAI's primary mainframe is on Pearl II."
X05_B01_002_020="QAI must be destroyed, my child, must be destroyed. I will accompany you to Pearl II and personally shut it down. Oh yes. We shall then use its Gate codes to gate directly to Earth, bypassing the other systems."
X05_B01_002_030="This is our only chance to destroy the Arch before it is operational. If we are unable to get those codes, we have no hope of reaching Earth. The surrounding systems are simply too heavily defended."
X05_B01_002_040="QAI is an abomination. I was wrong to have ever constructed it. So wrong. Oh yes. Too many mistakes that must be overcome. But this is one I can correct. One I will correct. No matter the cost."

X05_B01_002_060="I will see you soon, my child. See you soon."
X05_DB01_010_010="[{i Brackman}]: Before QAI was destroyed, I extracted its Gate codes. The path to Earth is now clear. Oh yes. I pray that the invasion will be successful. It is the only way to wipe the slate clean, start anew. You must win the day, my child, win it for all of us."
X05_DB01_020_010="[{i Hall}]: QAI is undoubtedly replicating itself across multiple systems, and the Seraphim arch is no doubt nearing completion. It's all going to hell. I'm ordering a wide-scale evacuation. We have no choice but to hide."
X05_DB01_030_010="[{i HQ}]: The operation has ended in failure. All is lost."
X05_DB01_040_010="[{i HQ}]: Commander? Can you read me? Ah hell, I think the Commander is dea --"
X05_M01_010_010="[{i HQ}]: Your top priority is to clear this area of enemies so Fletcher can gate in and construct a base."
X05_M01_011_010="[{i HQ}]: Both Hex5 and QAI are operating in the area, so be ready for one hell of a fight."
X05_M01_012_010="[{i HQ}]: Get it in gear, Commander. HQ out."
X05_M01_013_010="[{i Hex5}]: It's too bad about Dostya. The Master felt that she had such promise. She would've made a fine disciple."
X05_M01_014_010="[{i Brackman}]: I have tolerated you in the past, Hex5, forgiven your eccentricities. Oh yes. But no more. Today you will answer for your crimes."
X05_M01_015_010="[{i Hex5}]: You are an old fool. The Master is more powerful than you can imagine."
X05_M01_016_010="[{i Brackman}]: We shall see. Oh yes. We shall see."
X05_M01_020_010="[{i HQ}]: Clear the area, Commander. Fletcher is suited up and ready to gate. HQ out."
X05_M01_030_010="[{i HQ}]: Fletcher is ready to gate, Commander. Waiting on you to clear the area. HQ out."
X05_M01_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I'm on-ground and on-target, Colonel. Let's unplug that damn computer and head home. Fletcher out."
X05_M01_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: It's about time, Commander. I was starting to think that you and QAI were building a little love nest."
X05_M01_060_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Took your sweet old time, didn't you? QAI isn't going to kill itself, you know."
X05_M01_070_010="[{i HQ}]: Hex5 has a handful of small bases in the canyons. Destroy them. HQ out."

X05_M01_110_010="[{i Fletcher}]: This whole damn thing is a mess. Cybrans turning on each other? Aeon switching sides just cause some Princess shows up? I tell you, we can't trust any of them. The blue of the UEF, that's what matters. That's the only thing that matters. Fletcher out."
X05_M01_120_010="[{i Brackman}]: So much of this is my fault. Oh yes. The loyalty program, QAI. Foolish choices were made, foolish choices. It is time to make things right. Oh yes. Make them right. Be safe, my child."
X05_M01_130_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Kael is unleashing extreme measures. She has leveled an entire city, killing millions. Civil war is spreading across Aeon-controlled space. There is no way the Order will be able to survive. Rhiza out."
X05_M01_140_010="[{i Rhiza}]: A Loyalist named Amalia is being held in a prison to your east, which has been marked for capture. Capture the prison and free Amalia. Rhiza out."

X05_M01_160_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Please rescue Amalia, Commander. Rhiza out."
X05_M01_170_010="[{i Amalia}]: Before I was captured, I managed to place a Trojan Horse in QAI's sub-systems. Unless they find it, I may be able to use it to help you. Amalia out."

X05_M01_190_010="[{i Brackman}]: Hex5 is south of Fletcher's position. He must be eliminated. Oh yes."

X05_M02_200_009="[{i Hex5}]: Wait! Master!"
X05_M02_200_010="[{i Brackman}]: And so a traitor dies. Oh yes. So much loss. So much sorrow."

X05_M03_135_010="[{i Brackman}]: At last I shall have peace."
X05_M03_140_010="[{i HQ}]: Attack inbound on your position. HQ out."
X05_M03_150_010="[{i HQ}]: This can't be right ... I'm picking up multiple experimental-class signatures from QAI's position, and they register as Aeon and UEF experimentals. HQ out."
X05_M03_150_020="[{i QAI}]: The Seven Hand Node was quite effective at obtaining the schematics to your weapon systems. Now you shall be destroyed by your own weapons."
X05_M03_170_010="[{i HQ}]: QAI is operating two large resource bases in the area. One is home to most of its Mass fabricators while the other is wall-to-wall power generators. Both bases are targets of opportunity, but you should destroy them if able. HQ out."

X05_M03_260_010="[{i HQ}]: Both of QAI's resource bases have been destroyed. HQ out."
X05_M03_270_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Hall's snooping around. Gotta watch him, Colonel. Our list of friends keeps getting shorter and shorter. Fletcher out."
X05_M03_290_010="[{i Amalia}]: Champion, the Trojan Horse is still operational. I have marked a Science Facility for capture; if you seize it, the Colossus next to the Facility will be yours to command. Amalia out."
X05_M03_300_010="[{i Amalia}]: The Science Facility still needs to be captured, Champion. Amalia out."
X05_M03_310_010="[{i Amalia}]: A free Colossus awaits you if can capture the Science Facility, Champion. Amalia out."
X05_M03_320_010="[{i Amalia}]: The Colossus is yours, Champion! Use it to wreak havoc upon your enemies! Glory to the Princess! Amalia out."
X05_M03_322_010="[{i Brackman}]: I am in position, my child. I shall take it from here. It's just a simple matter of interfacing. Oh yes."
X05_M03_323_010="[{i QAI}]: You are an old fool. It was the Seraphim that made me what I am, not you."
X05_M03_324_010="[{i Brackman}]: A father always knows the child's weakness. Oh yes. There is always a weakness."
X05_M03_325_040="[{i QAI}]: Your efforts will be for -- what are you doing? That is not possible."
X05_M03_326_010="[{i Brackman}]: Goodbye, QAI."
X05_M03_327_010="[{i Brackman}]: Goodbye."
X05_M03_329_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I'm getting pounded from all sides! I have to get out of here! Recalling!"
X05_M03_330_010="[{i HQ}]: Doctor Brackman?"
X05_M03_330_020="[{i Brackman}]: It is over. QAI is destroyed. We would be wise to dispatch technicians, though, have them search through QAI's systems. Just to be safe."

X05_M03_340_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Champion, you did not capture the Science Facility in time. The enemy Colossus is operational and heading your way. Rhiza out."

X05_T01_003_010="[{i QAI}]: Your experimental unit may actually be dangerous if completed. Ergo, I will destroy it now."

X06_B01_001_010="Gotta keep this one short and sweet, Commander. The Seraphim are rushing to complete their Arch, and we need to prevent that from happening. With QAI destroyed and the Order descending into anarchy, this is the time to strike."
X06_B01_001_020="The mission is simple: You will go to Earth and destroy the Arch. Fletcher and Rhiza will gate in first and clear the area around your LZ. Once you're on the ground, build up your forces and attack."
X06_B01_001_030="The destruction of the Arch does not mean the end of the Seraphim threat, however. The Rift still must be sealed. Once the Arch is destroyed, I will travel to Earth and enter the Rift. Once inside, I shall close it forever."
X06_B01_001_045="There's no reason for you to do that, Princess Burke. We've got techs working on a solution. They just need a little more time."
X06_B01_001_060="We have no way of knowing what is happening on the Seraphim side of the Rift. What if they are constructing an Arch on that side as well? We cannot take that chance. We are out of time."
X06_B01_001_070="Look what happened when you came out of hiding. What do you think is going to happen if you die? Things will go from bad to worse."
X06_B01_001_080="The Seraphim represent our greatest threat. Without them, Kael is nothing. She is easily defeated. But the Seraphim are a danger as long as the Rift remains. It must be closed."
X06_B01_001_090="Commander, you have your orders. You gate immediately."
X06_DB01_010_010="[{i Hall}]: The Rift is sealed, and the Order is on the run. Sadly, there's no sign of Princess Burke, but we'll keep looking."
X06_DB01_020_010="[{i Hall}]: The Seraphim are pouring through the Rift at an alarming rate. There is no stopping them. We are doomed."
X06_DB01_030_010="[{i HQ}]: Commander? You there? Dammit."
X06_M01_010_010="[{i HQ}]: Got green lights across the board, Commander. Fletcher is to your northeast and Rhiza is to the northwest. Both will assist as able. HQ out."
X06_M01_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Here are some reinforcements, Colonel. And watch your back -- I've got a bad feeling about this OP."
X06_M01_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I've been ordered to provide you with reinforcements, Commander. Just don't go thinking this makes us friends -- I know how you chip-heads operate."

X06_M01_070_010="[{i Hall}]: Keep your eyes on Fletcher, Colonel. I had no choice but to send him on this OP, and we can't afford any slip ups. At the first sign of trouble, we're recalling him. Hall out."
X06_M01_080_010="[{i Brackman}]: Our long struggle is nearing its end, my child. Oh yes. Be safe."
X06_M01_090_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Kael is becoming increasingly desperate, and the Order has descended into madness. Rhiza out."
X06_M01_100_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Our attack begins. Glory to the Princess!"

X06_M02_010_030="[{i Fletcher}]: Why should I help you? You're no different from the rest of them. Once this over, you're going to turn on us."
X06_M02_010_040="[{i Hall}]: Brigadier General Fletcher! You have your orders! You will assist Crusader Rhiza."
X06_M02_010_050="[{i Fletcher}]: You sold us out, Hall. Allied us with monsters and freaks. Once I get my hands on Black Sun, I'll be able rebuild it and end this once and for all."
X06_M02_010_060="[{i Hall}]: What the hell are you talking about? Black Sun is destroyed. The Aeon and Cybran are our allies."
X06_M02_010_070="[{i Fletcher}]: You fool. They're scheming and plotting right under your nose, and you're too blind to notice."
X06_M02_010_080="[{i Hall}]: HQ, recall Fletcher. I want him out of there!"
X06_M02_010_090="[{i HQ}]: His recall beacon is disabled. Nothing we can do from this end."
X06_M02_011_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I spent a lot of time thinking about this. There's only one possible outcome. One way for this to end."
X06_M02_012_010="[{i Rhiza}]: Damn him! Can't the UEF control their own soldiers?"
X06_M02_013_010="[{i HQ}]: Looks like the nut has finally cracked, Commander. HQ out."

X06_M02_030_010="[{i Brackman}]: My child, General Hall has authorized you to stop Brigadier Fletcher. Use any means necessary. He must not interfere with our plans."
X06_M02_030_020="[{i Rhiza}]: Doctor, I will help as I am able, but I am currently fighting the Seraphim. Rhiza out."
X06_M02_040_010="[{i Princess}]: Champion, the UEF has disowned Fletcher. Deal with him."
X06_M02_040_020="[{i Rhiza}]: Champion, I am doing battle with the Seraphim, but I will assist if I am able. Rhiza out."

X06_M02_150_010="[{i HQ}]: Just got an update regarding the Black Sun Control Center. It's linked to the old Option Zero defense network, and it looks like some of those weapons are still online.

X1MP_014_Description="During the summer months, the bed of the Strip Mine floods, preventing the colonists from getting much work done. Recently, the colony has cut off all communication with the UEF, and any signals sent by the Coalition have been ignored. The state of the system and its colonies remains unknown."
X1MP_017_Description="A strange anomaly makes Quantum communication difficult with this system. However, that has not prevented both the Coalition and Seraphim/Order from eyeing this planet as a perfect staging ground for secret attacks into enemy territory."
X1TU_0000="Congratulations, Colonel. Training exercise completed."
X1T_TU01_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Listen up, Colonel. These exercises will fully train you in all operational aspects of your Armored Command Unit (ACU), including the construction and deployment of structures and units. You need to get through this stuff as quickly as possible because the Order and their alien buddies are kicking the crap out of us from one end of the galaxy to the other. So pay attention."
X1T_TU01_010_020="[{i Fletcher}]: The first thing you need to learn is how to navigate the battlefield."
X1T_TU02_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: This exercise is brain dead simple, but the fat cats make me run everyone through it. There are two ways to pan the battlefield -- with the mouse and with the arrow keys. To use the mouse, simply move the pointer to the edge of the map, and it'll automatically scroll. Pressing and holding the arrow keys does the same thing."
X1T_TU02_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Excellent work, Commander."
X1T_TU02_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Your ACU offers a full view of the battlefield, including the ability to zoom in and out. You use the mouse wheel -- or Q and W keys -- to zoom in and out. "
X1T_TU02_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Good. Let's move on."
X1T_TU02_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Center the screen over the objective markers, Commander."
X1T_TU02_060_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Let's go, Commander! Complete the objective."
X1T_TU02_070_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Zoom out until you see the objective marker."
X1T_TU02_080_010="[{i Fletcher}]: We don't have all day, Commander!"
X1T_TU02_OBJ_010_010="Pan the Battlefield"
X1T_TU02_OBJ_010_020="Use either the mouse or the arrow keys to center the camera on each marker."
X1T_TU02_OBJ_010_030="Zoom Out"
X1T_TU02_OBJ_010_040="Zoom out until you see a marker. Use either the mouse wheel or the correct key. "
X1T_TU03_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Now it's time to take your ACU for a stroll. Left-click the ACU to select it and right-click on a map location to give it a move order."
X1T_TU03_010_020="[{i Fletcher}]: When you're ready, move your ACU to the designated location on the map."
X1T_TU03_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Well done."
X1T_TU03_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Commander, left-click to select your ACU and right-click to move. "
X1T_TU03_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Let's see if we can speed this up, okay?"
X1T_TU03_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Your ACU is a powerful weapons system, and can easily fend off lower-level enemy units. To attack an enemy, select your ACU and right-click on the unit you want to destroy. Remember, your ACU will automatically attack as soon as it's within range."
X1T_TU03_050_020="[{i Fletcher}]: Attack and destroy the enemy unit."
X1T_TU03_060_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Good job soldier, but don't get too cocky."
X1T_TU03_070_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Destroy that unit, Commander."
X1T_TU03_080_010="[{i Fletcher}]: If you take this long on a real battlefield, you won't last five seconds. Get it done."
X1T_TU03_OBJ_010_010="ACU Movement"
X1T_TU03_OBJ_010_020="Move your ACU to the target area."
X1T_TU03_OBJ_010_030="Attack with ACU"
X1T_TU03_OBJ_010_040="Attack and destroy the enemy unit with your ACU."
X1T_TU04_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Two resources create and maintain everything you build: Mass and Energy. In order to have a fully functioning economy, you must balance how you gather and spend each resource."
X1T_TU04_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: This HUD element indicates how much Energy you're gathering and spending, while this HUD element shows your intake of Mass. If you spend more than you're bringing in, you will have negative income and run the risk of stalling your economy."
X1T_TU04_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: You obtain Mass by building Mass extractors on Mass deposits; Mass deposits are displayed on your HUD as a green box with a green X through its middle. You can also get Mass with Mass fabricators and by reclamation."
X1T_TU04_030_020="[{i Fletcher}]: I want you to build three Mass extractors. Select your ACU, click the Mass extractor icon in the Build UI, and then click on one of the highlighted Mass deposits. Do this for each extractor."
X1T_TU04_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Well done. You're now collecting Mass."
X1T_TU04_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Let's get those three Mass extractors built, Commander."
X1T_TU04_060_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Can't build anything without Mass. Complete your objective."
X1T_TU04_070_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Energy is collected through the use of power generators. There are three levels of power generators, and unlike Mass extractors, they can be built anywhere on the map. "
X1T_TU04_070_020="[{i Fletcher}]: Your orders are to construct two power generators. Select your ACU, click on the power generator icon in the Build UI, and then click on any open location on the ground. "
X1T_TU04_080_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Now that those generators are online, you'll receive a steady stream of Energy."
X1T_TU04_090_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Build two power generators, Commander."
X1T_TU04_100_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Got Order forces beating on the door, Commander. Build the power generators."
X1T_TU04_110_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Okay, let's start constructing an army. Factories build Engineers and tactical units like tanks, bombers and submarines. Go ahead and build a Land Factory."
X1T_TU04_120_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Well done, Commander. Now you can start constructing an army."
X1T_TU04_130_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Build the Land Factory, Commander."
X1T_TU04_140_010="[{i Fletcher}]: You waiting for an invitation? Build the Land Factory."
X1T_TU04_OBJ_010_010="Build Mass Extractors"
X1T_TU04_OBJ_010_020="Build a Mass extractor on each of the three Mass deposits. "
X1T_TU04_OBJ_010_030="Build Power Generators"
X1T_TU04_OBJ_010_040="Build two power generators."
X1T_TU04_OBJ_010_050="Build Land Factory"
X1T_TU04_OBJ_010_060="Build one Land Factory."
X1T_TU05_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Now that you have a Land Factory, you can construct mobile land units -- left-click on the factory to select it and then click on the units you want to build. For this exercise, construct two light assault bots and two light artillery. Each time you click on a unit icon, it will be added to the factory's Build Queue."
X1T_TU05_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Good job. Now you have the beginnings of an actual army."
X1T_TU05_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Let's get those units built, Commander."
X1T_TU05_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Can't fight the UEF's enemies with harsh language, Commander. Build those units."
X1T_TU05_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Control groups let you quickly select a group of units without having to use the mouse. To create a control group, drag-select or Shift-click the units you created and press Ctrl+1. Those units are now in control group 1; if you press the number 1 key, you will automatically select all units within the control group."
X1T_TU05_050_020="[{i Fletcher}]: Make a control group."
X1T_TU05_060_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Now you're cooking."
X1T_TU05_070_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Go ahead and make a control group, Commander."
X1T_TU05_080_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Let's get it done, Commander. Create a control group."
X1T_TU05_OBJ_010_010="Build Land Units"
X1T_TU05_OBJ_010_020="Build two light assault bots and two light artillery units."
X1T_TU05_OBJ_010_030="Make a Control Group"
X1T_TU05_OBJ_010_040="Drag-select or Shift-click the units you constructed and press Ctrl+1."
X1T_TU06_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Factories also produce Engineers, which are able to construct structures that are unavailable to your ACU, like Mass and Energy storage and radar and sonar installations. Engineers can also reclaim structures and units, capture enemy units, repair damaged units and structures and assist with other construction."
X1T_TU06_010_020="[{i Fletcher}]: Construct two Engineers from the Land Factory."
X1T_TU06_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: That a fella. Well done."
X1T_TU06_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Build two Engineers, Commander."
X1T_TU06_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: C'mon, Commander, let's get those Engineers built."
X1T_TU06_050_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Both your ACU and Engineers can capture enemy units or structures, and nothing drives those Order scumbags crazier than watching you use their own gear against them. A power generator has been placed on the map -- capture it with your Engineers by selecting the Engineers and right-clicking on the power generator."
X1T_TU06_060_010="[{i Fletcher}]: That power generator is now under your control. Good job."
X1T_TU06_070_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Capture the power generator with your Engineers, Commander."
X1T_TU06_080_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Let's get with it, Commander. Capture the power generator."
X1T_TU06_090_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Never know when one of those damn aliens is going to show up, so always fortify your base with defensive structures. Point defenses offer decent protection and can fend off most land-based attacks. Build a point defense at the marked location."
X1T_TU06_100_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Good. Now if you're attacked, you'll at least have a fighting chance."
X1T_TU06_110_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Commander, build a point defense at the marked location. "
X1T_TU06_120_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Build that point defense, Commander."
X1T_TU06_130_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Well, what do you know -- here come some enemy units. Good thing you built a point defense."
X1T_TU06_140_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Defending against land-based attacks is only half the battle; you also need to be able to ward off air attacks. Build an anti-air tower at the designated spot."
X1T_TU06_150_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Maybe we'll make a commander out of you, yet. Good job."
X1T_TU06_160_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Get that anti-air built, Commander."
X1T_TU06_170_010="[{i Fletcher}]: If the enemy sends in bombers, you're a sitting duck. Build that AA."
X1T_TU06_180_010="[{i Fletcher}]: The enemy is attacking with bombers. Now aren't you glad that you built that AA?"
X1T_TU06_OBJ_010_010="Build Engineers"
X1T_TU06_OBJ_010_020="Build two Engineers from the Land Factory."
X1T_TU06_OBJ_010_030="Capture Power Generator"
X1T_TU06_OBJ_010_040="Capture the power generator with your Engineers."
X1T_TU06_OBJ_010_050="Build a Point Defense"
X1T_TU06_OBJ_010_060="Build a point defense at the marked location."
X1T_TU06_OBJ_010_070="Build Anti-Air"
X1T_TU06_OBJ_010_080="Build an anti-air tower at the designated location on the map."
X1T_TU07_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: You can have all of the tanks and bombers you want, but if you don't know what the enemy is up to, you'll be fighting with one hand tied behind your back. That's why one of the most critical parts of waging war is intelligence. Radar is a critical component in gathering intel on your enemies. Build one now at the designated location."
X1T_TU07_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Now you can keep tabs on the enemy. Good work."
X1T_TU07_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Build a radar, Commander."
X1T_TU07_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Can't fight if you're blind, Commander. Build that radar."
X1T_TU07_OBJ_010_010="Build Radar"
X1T_TU07_OBJ_010_020="Build a radar at the designated location."
X1T_TU08_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Your radar has uncovered the existence of a small Order base. Build up an army and destroy that base!"
X1T_TU08_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I love seeing Order units burn. Great job, Commander."
X1T_TU08_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Wipe out that enemy base, Commander."
X1T_TU08_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: I want that enemy base destroyed. Get it done."
X1T_TU08_OBJ_010_010="Destroy the Enemy Base"
X1T_TU08_OBJ_010_020="Create an army and attack and destroy the Order base. Leave nothing standing."
X1T_TU09_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Picking up a larger Order base to the north. We're sending you reinforcements; add them to your attack force and erase that enemy base. I want nothing left standing."
X1T_TU09_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Scratch one scumbag. I love seeing Order commanders going up like that."
X1T_TU09_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Destroy the enemy commander."
X1T_TU09_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: You waiting for that scumbag to come over and introduce himself? Attack and destroy him."
X1T_TU09_OBJ_010_010="Destroy the Enemy Commander"
X1T_TU09_OBJ_010_020="Attack and destroy both the enemy commander and the base.  "
X1T_TU10_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: To access more powerful weapons, you need to upgrade your factories. There are a total of three tech levels: Tech 1, Tech 2 and Tech 3. To upgrade to Tech 2, select your Land Factory and then click the Upgrade Icon."
X1T_TU10_010_020="[{i Fletcher}]: Upgrade your Land Factory to Tech 2."
X1T_TU10_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Excellent. You can now build Tech 2 units and Engineers."
X1T_TU10_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Let's get that Land Factory upgraded, Commander."
X1T_TU10_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Going to take more than pea-shooters to win this war, Commander. Upgrade your factory."
X1T_TU10_OBJ_010_010="Upgrade Factory"
X1T_TU10_OBJ_010_020="Upgrade your factory to Tech 2."
X1T_TU11_010_010="[{i Fletcher}]: If you've done your homework, you know that most OPs will take place on massive battlefields. Transports are the most effective way of moving units across vast distances. There are multiple ways to use transports, so check your field manual. For the purposes of this exercise, we're only going to cover basic use, and we've given you a transport."
X1T_TU11_010_020="[{i Fletcher}]: To load a transport, select the units you wish to transport and then right-click on the transport. Once the transport is full, select it, click the Transport icon and then the spot on the map where the transport should unload. "
X1T_TU11_010_030="[{i Fletcher}]: Load a transport and move it to the designated location."
X1T_TU11_020_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Now you know the basics of transports. Good job."
X1T_TU11_030_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Transport those units, Commander."
X1T_TU11_040_010="[{i Fletcher}]: Get that transport loaded, Commander."
X1T_TU11_OBJ_010_010="Use Transport "
