-- TrashBag is a class to help manage objects that need destruction. You add objects to it with Add().
-- When TrashBag:Destroy() is called, it calls Destroy() in turn on all its contained objects.
--
-- If an object in a TrashBag is destroyed through other means, it automatically disappears from the TrashBag.
-- This doesn't necessarily happen instantly, so it's possible in this case that Destroy() will be called twice.
-- So Destroy() should always be idempotent.

-- The Trashbag is a global entity. You can use these upvalued versions to improve
-- the performance of functions using the trashbag. According to the function-scope
-- benchmark the performance is increased by about 10%.
