-- QUERY
-- A facility for players to ask a question of another player and receive a
-- response. Suppose we have users W,X,Y,Z. A query from W->X begins in W's
-- user layer. It is marshalled into the Sim and sent to all players (W,X,Y,Z).
-- Each Sim processes the query and sends it back up into their respective user
-- layers. Although all players can see the queries and do work on them, only
-- the army the query is intended for (specified in the .To field of the
-- queryData) can generate a result for the query. The result begins in the user
-- layer of the target army and the information is passed back to everyone in
-- exactly the same way the query originally started.
--
-- This file is the USER side of the query system. The other half lives in
-- /lua/SimPlayerQuery.lua
--

-- result)
local QueryListeners = {}
function AddQueryListener( queryName, callback )
    table.insert( QueryListeners, { Name=queryName, Callback=callback } )
end

-- Listeners interested in specific query results
local ResultListeners = {}

    table.insert( ResultListeners, { Name=queryName, Callback=callback } )

-- Primary entry point of the query system. Call Query with queryData with a
-- minimum form of:
--   data = {
--       From = <armyIndex>  -- who the query is coming from
--       To = <armyIndex>    -- who the query is going to
--       Name = <queryName>  -- name of the query type
--   }
--
-- resultCallback is function called when the query results are returned (if
-- ever)
--
-- Calls OnPlayerQuery(queryData) in the sim. All players will receive it
-- regardless of whether their focus army is specified in the From or To fields.
-- This allows everyone to inspect all query traffic.

--       Name = <queryName>  -- name of the query type

-- up to the user layer.

-- UserSync calls this when new queries arrive. The query may or may not be
-- for this focusArmy. It is the query listeners job to filter out queries meant
-- for other users. This lets anyone hear all traffic for any query type.
