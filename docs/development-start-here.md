# At the start of a journey

Exciting times - welcome Commander to assist in improving the status quo of FAForever. Contributors are the bread and butter of our community. The association and all of its assets exist because of them. Here you'll learn the best practices surrounding Lua development for the game. 

Do note that this is not a guide on how to write Lua code or on how development works in general. It is also not a guide on how Git and/or GitHub works.
