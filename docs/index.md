Forged Alliance Forever is a vibrant, community-driven [project](https://github.com/FAForever) designed to enhance the gameplay of [Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/9420).

We provide a rich gaming experience with an extensive library of community-made maps, mods and co-op scenarios. The project can be financially supported through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/faf).
