# Game version 3763 (23th of July, 2023)

See the patch notes of 3762 and 3758 for the full patch notes.

There was a misconception with the distribution of files and as a result, wrecks would be removed in the release branch when you build on top of them. It was fun while it lasted ^^

## Features

- (#5262) Introduce the ability to cap additional structures

  You can now also cap the following structures:

  - Tech 3 air factories with tech 3 power generators
  - Tech 3 or experimental artillery with tech 3 power generators

  To use these you need the game option 'Automate Structure Ringing' to be on 'Full Suite'

## Bug fixes

- (#5266) Fix wrecks being removed when constructing on top of them

- (#5265) Fix the UI scaling of the unit cheat menu

  The visuals can now be seen when you're zoomed out and the Mercy deals exactly 600 area damage at the center of the target

- (#5191) Fix the size of the zapper on the Cybran Aircraft Carrier
