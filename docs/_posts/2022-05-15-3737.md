# Game version 3737 (15th of May, 2022)

### Features

- (Engine patch) Introduction of alternative profiling function for better accuracy (ff630c8)

- (Engine patch) Maximum game speed is set to +50 (adc06ef5)
  Note that the interface (for replays, for example) has not been adjusted yet. Usually anything
  above +10 is only applicable in the first few minutes of the game.

- Add button to lobby to access patch notes (#3842)
  Another contribution of Rowey: introduces a button in the lobby to access the patch notes.

- Add Cloak Enhancement restriction option (#3844)
  Allows the host to restrict the cloak enhancement of the Cybran ACU / SACU.

- Add proper recursive logging (#3861, #3869)
  Introduces the functions 'reprs' and 'reprsl'. They are abbreviations for 'Recursive printing safe' and
  'Recursive printing safe to log'. It introduces an alternative to 'repr' which can get stuck in a recursive
  loop when trying to stringify units, projectiles, weapons and / or props. The old repr functions is available
  as 'repru', which is an abbreviation for 'Recursive printing unsafe'. The function 'repr' refers to 'reprs'.

### Bug fixes

- (Engine patch) Disable mesh rendering for minimap (#7)

- (Engine patch) Fix a crash when restarting a map with a Salem (#6)

- (Engine patch) Fix a crash when air units have a collision of 'None' (1b17fe7)

- (Engine patch) Excludes negative income and problems from this (1b17fe7)
  The problem in question is complicated and happens in every game, but it noticeable when it
  happens to a commander. The negative income causes the commander to not be 'fully built', and that causes
  a player to lose the game. This could happen when the commander was being repaired.

- (Engine patch) Fix a crash when the mouse is pointing towards the sky, away from the terrain (3bf0ba5)

- Fix mass fabricator behavior for multiplayer (#3852)
  Fixes an issue where the new fabricators could seriously hamper the performance of the game

- Fix reclaim effects (#3865)
  Fixes an issue where the beam glitches out when reclaiming a unit

- Fix destruction sound of units being played twice (#3868)
  Was especially noticeable on the Spiderbot

### Performance

- (Engine patch) Improve performance of common table operations (ff630c8, da692d3)

- Optimize abstract projectile classes (#3847, #3855, #3866, #3867)
  Further reduces the load on the CPU when projectiles are taking part in the simulation

- Clean up defaultunits.lua (#3806)
  Improves documentation, while removing engine calls, empty functions and duplicated code

### Other

- Fix coloring of lobby buttons (#3846)
  Rowey has keen eyes - fixes a few textures having the wrong colors when in the lobby when
  you select the UEF faction

- Minor autobalance-related improvements (#3849)
  Prevents a no-op swap where a player is switched with him / herself

- Fix two UI layout functions (#3848)
