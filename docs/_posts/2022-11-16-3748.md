# Game version 3748 (16th of November, 2022)

## Bug fixes

- (#4414) Revert changes to prefetching of assets
  We thought we understood how prefetching worked, but we were wrong. As a result some
  people ran out of memory. That results in an application crash.

  We reverted the changes.

## Contributors

- Jip (#4414)
