# Game version 3731 (30th of December, 2021)

### Features

- Improve scoreboard (#3633)
  Adds the share conditions to the scoreboard. Adds tooltip for
  the share condition, explaining what it means. Adds information
  to the share condition tooltip on how to find the remaining
  game options. Adds a tooltip for the map name to include the
  map description. The replay ID can be found in the map description.

  This last one is a bit unintuitive, but the replay ID is 99% of the time
  not relevant information. It would take up UI space if we'd just put
  it there regardless.

  Once the map generator is updated the settings used to generate
  the map are set as its map description. That way you can view those
  settings in game when required.

### Bug fixes

- Fix filtering insignificant units (#3636)
  We made the assumption that categories.INSIGNIFICANTUNIT
  was not widely used by mods. This was wrong - hence we still
  introduced a new category specifically for units that inherit the
  DummyUnit class. These units should not be reachable by code
  as they are not a typical unit - they lack all the functions you'd
  expect.

  Fixes (for example) the anti teleporting mechanic of Blackops.

- Update initialisation files (#3637)
  Allows loading `kyros.nxt` on the regular branch. Adds
  proper checks on the extension of maps / mods instead to
  prevent loading in rar / zip / scd files as mods. Improves
  debugging information: as an example when something is
  excluded the user is informed through the log. Introduces
  the removal of incompatible shaders. Incompatible here
  means shaders of previous versions of FAF.

### Other

- Revert "Snowflakes in lobby (#3615)" (#3634)
  Removes the snow flakes from the lobby.
