### Hover Tanks

- Seraphim (Yenzyne)
  - Build time: 880 → 1050
  - Speed on water: 4.3 → 3
- Aeon (Blaze)
  - Build time: 880 → 1050
  - Speed on water: 4.3 → 3

### Hover flak (Seraphim and Aeon)

- Speed: 3.6 → 3

### Seraphim Tech 2 bot and Tech 3 Tank Changes

- We are carefully toning down both areas while keeping the idea behind it intact. Ilshavoh becomes weaker, and Othuum becomes stronger.

### Ilshavoh

- Turret turn rate: 180°/s → 70°/s

### Othuum

- Speed: 2.5 → 2.6

### Harbinger

- Will now take longer to make, making it harder to spam them so fast and allowing opponents slightly more time to bring counters into play.
- Veterancy: 15/30/45/60/75 → 18/36/54/72/90
- Build time: 3600 → 4500
- Can no longer fire while reclaiming

### Sniper bots (Seraphim and Aeon)

- It is annoying when sniper bots lose all their damage while moving and trying to shoot. They will hit more often now, even - though using them stationary will still lead to the best results.
- Firing randomness when moving: 0.8 → 0.5

### UEF T3MAA

- Other faction’s T3 MAA were hitting much better than the UEF one. This change is improving its accuracy to similar levels.
- Slight tracking added with small turn rate (20)
- Muzzle velocity: 100 → 110

### Navy

- Summit
  - Is now more expensive, giving other factions more time to beat them before they are able to gather a critical mass.
  - Mass cost: 9000 → 10500
  - Energy cost: 54000 → 62000
  - Build time: 28800 → 33000
  - Area of effect: 3 → 2
- Aeon Frigates
  - Will now be more effective vs hover, but not vs ships.
  - Hit points: 1800 → 1850
  - Damage per shot: 140 → 50
  - Reload time: 5 seconds → 1.7 seconds (DPS: 56 → 58)
  - MuzzleChargeDelay: 0.5 → 0
  - Anti-torpedo weapon reload time: 10 → 12.5

### Air

- Strategic bombers (all factions)
  - Increasing the energy cost of strategic bombers to avoid the ability to rush them so easily.
  - Energy cost: 105000 → 144000
  - Build time: 8400 → 9600
- Corsair
  - Reducing the speed of their projectiles to make them as easy (or hard) to dodge as they were before the range decrease.
  - muzzle velocity: 35 → 30
- Torpedo bombers
  - We made several adjustments to allow torpedo bombers to actually deliver their torpedoes more often.
  - Reload time for all torpedo bombers: 12.5 → 10
- Uosioz (Seraphim Torpedo Bomber)
  - Torpedoes get now dropped in front of the bomber (like all other bombers)
  - Range: 42 → 35
  - Amount of volleys: 2 → 3
  - Now ignores torpedo defense (like all other torpedo bombers)
  - Multiple adjustments to torpedoes make them less likely to crash on the ground in shallow water
- Skimmer (Aeon T2 Torpedo Bomber)
  - Depth charges get now dropped in front of the bomber (like all other bombers)
  - Range: 42 → 35
  - Amount of volleys: 2 → 3
  - Multiple adjustments to depth charges make them less likely to crash on the ground in shallow water
- Solace (Aeon T3 Torpedo Bomber)
  - Range: 42 → 32
  - Projectile turn rate increased
- Awhassa
  - Added armour to ASF to guard them from the bomb, reducing their damage taken to 10%
  - Veterancy: 50/100/150/200/250 → 100/200/300/400/500
  - Reload time: 10 → 12

### Other

- Quantum Gateway
  - We are reducing the adjacency bonus for mass fabricators next to Quantum Gates to a more normal level.
  - Tech 2 mass fabricator: 2.5% → 0.75%
  - Tech 3 mass fabricator: 15% → 2.25%
  - Tech 3 power generator: 18.75% → 5%
  - Preset names improved
- T3 Land HQ
  - Build time: 9400 → 11000
- Sonars

  - T2 sonar

    - Mass cost: 120 → 150 (Seraphim stays 180)
    - Energy drain: 100 → 150

  - UEF/Aeon T3 sonar

    - Mass cost: 400 → 1000
    - Energy drain: 100 → 250

  - Cybran T3 sonar
    - Mass cost: 480 → 1200
    - Energy drain: 250 → 400

- Energy/Mass overflow
  - The bug that caused resources to disappear when they got shared to several teammates and one of them had full storage does not exist and is a FAF urban legend. If a teammate has full storage, the resources get properly shared to a different teammate instead. It is not needed to use any mods to prevent resources from getting lost or to inform others about this "bug".
  - No change required
