# Game version 3815 (29th of November, 2024)

Fix the autolobby messing with the expected server state. We hope the autolobby functions as expected now.

With thanks to Nomander for investigating the issue and deciphering a procedure to test the autolobby changes on the test server. Previously the changes were only tested locally by running multiple game instances on the same computer. When testing locally there is no server, and therefore we did not detect this issue sooner.

Apologies for the inconveniences,

With kind regards,

Jip
