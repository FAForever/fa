# Game version 3756 (18th of March, 2023)

Hopefully this is the last hotfix for now. Includes various fixes of recent and longstanding bugs.

## Features

- (#4770) Overhaul of the cheat menu
  The menu now inherits from the Window class, as a result it can be moved around and rescaled. Units
  can now be dragged into the game, instead of the old box spawn formation. Includes a section to
  spawn in props, meshes and a new section to preview and spawn in entire templates.

  This was long over due. The new cheat window is completely configurable, note the little wench next to the title.

## Bug fixes

- (#4805) Fix orientation of structures being applied multiple times after gifting or capturing

- (#4793) Fix disabling of the tabs (in the center) when you are in a replay and your focus army is defeated

- (#4806) Fix lingering draggers around window controls such as the chat and console window

- (#4807) Add a check before applying a platoon function to fix a co-op problem

- (#4804, #4813) Fix various options not listening to the game settings
  This includes the following options:

  - Options for the water depth indicator
  - Options for the plane height indicator
  - Toggle for rendering mouse positions when observing

- (#4809) Re-order the sync in an attempt to mitigate 'unknown results' of ladder games

- (#4812) Fix overcharge damage not scaling with your power supply

## Other changes

- (#4795) Lobby option to share unit cap now defaults to share the unit cap to all allies

- (#4800) Auto-hide the mass fab panel when you change to the observers view

- (#4789) Forward the old ACU-kill event to the UI layer
