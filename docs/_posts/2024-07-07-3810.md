# Game Version 3810

## Bug Fixes

- Fix Ahwassa's bomb dealing full damage to ASF.
- Fix partially built units not transferring properly in Full Share.
- Fix a typo in the script file of the Seraphim Tech 3 Mass Fabricator.
- Fix the Seraphim Tech 3 Mass Fabricator's rotators not spinning down when production is disabled.

## Balance

- Make shields absorb ACU explosions.

  Both mobile and static shields absorb full damage from ACU explosions. For example, this prevents ACU explosions from killing all engineers inside shielded bases/firebases or killing all units in mobile-shielded T2 armies.
  The structure part of static shields still takes reduced structure damage from ACU explosions.

- Allow Mongoose to fire from transports.

- Increase UEF T3 MAA's DPS and damage, and swap its speed with Aeon's T3 MAA.

  - Cougar: DPS: 176 -> 206, Damage per volley: 1200 -> 1400, Speed: 3.3 -> 3.5
  - Redeemer: Speed: 3.5 -> 3.3

  This brings its DPS closer in line with other factions, lets it 3 shot strategic bombers instead of 4 shot, and lets it better escort Titans/Parashields.
  Redeemer's extra speed wasn't very necessary for its role within Aeon, so it was chosen to be swapped with.

- Fine tune the balance of the Tech 2 Navy stage.

  - Uashavoh: T2 Destroyer (XSS0201):
    - AntiTorpedo RateOfFire: 0.26 -> 0.3
  - Salem Class: T2 Destroyer (URS0201):
    - BackUpDistance: 5 -> 10
  - Cooper: T2 Torpedo Boat (XES0102):
    - Health: 1750 -> 2000

- After receiving several buffs, the Seraphim Tech 3 Submarine Hunter has become too oppressive, especially in larger formations. These changes aim to bring it back in line, while keeping its identity.

  - Yathsou: T3 Submarine Hunter (XSS0304):
    - Damage: 290 -> 380
    - RateOfFire: 0.25 -> 0.22
    - MuzzleSalvoDelay: 0.7 -> 1
    - MuzzleSalvoSize: 5 -> 4
    - DPS: 363 -> 338
    - Torpedo Defense RateOfFire (x2): 0.15 -> 0.1

- The `BuildRate` and `BuildTime` stats of all Radars and Sonars are updated to be more streamlined. The build time of Tech 2 Sonars is corrected to ensure it is not longer than that of Tech 3 Sonars. Tech 3 Sonars get their very low build time increased, to compensate for their Tech 2 counterparts being much quicker to build and providing more build power.

  - Tech 1 Radars
    - BuildRate: 14.08 -> 13
  - Tech 2 Radars
    - BuildRate: 21.46 -> 20
    - BuildTime: 845 -> 780
  - Tech 3 Radars
    - BuildTime: 2575 -> 2400
  - Tech 1 Sonars
    - BuildRate: 14.08 -> 13
    - BuildTime: 127.5 -> 125
    - BuildCostEnergy: 1275 -> 1250
  - Tech 2 Sonars
    - BuildRate: 15 -> 20
    - BuildTime: 1680 -> 780
    - BuildTime: 2120 -> 1040 (Seraphim)
  - Tech 3 Sonars
    - BuildTime: 750 -> 1200
    - BuildTime: 900 -> 1400 (Cybran)

- The `BuildRate` and `BuildTime` stats of several Shield Generators are updated to be more streamlined. The Seraphim Tech 2 Shield Generator gains build power, as it previously had a very low amount. The Aeon Tech 2 Shield Generator loses its build power, as it cannot be upgraded.

  - Tech 2 Shield Generators
    - BuildRate: 13.66 -> 0 (Aeon)
    - BuildRate: 12.98 -> 20 (Seraphim)
    - BuildRate: 19.95 -> 20 (UEF)
  - Tech 3 Shield Generators
    - BuildTime: 5841 -> 5800 (Seraphim)
    - BuildTime: 4988 -> 5000 (UEF)

- Reduce TML HP and add a Death Weapon

  - HP: 1500 -> 900
  - Death Weapon
    - Damage: 750
    - AoE (UEF/Aeon/Sera): 2
    - AoE (Cybran): 3

- Increase the hitpoints of the Aeon Tech 1 MAA so that it can survive a single bomb from a Seraphim Tech 1 bomber.

  - Thistle: T1 Mobile Anti-Air Gun (UAL0104):
    - MaxHealth: 250 -> 265

- Allow the Selen to activate its cloak more quickly and increase the vision and radar radius it retains after cloaking itself.
  - Selen: T1 Combat Scout (XSL0101):
    - StealthWaitTime: 3 -> 1.5
    - VisionRadius while stealthed/cloaked: 0.6 -> 0.8
    - RadarRadius while stealthed/cloaked: 0.6 -> 0.8

## Features

- Make various structures easier to place to help with base building.

  - All Tech 3 Power Generators, Tech 3 Mass Fabricators, Tech 3 Artilleries, Shield Structures, Land Factories and Air Factories:
    - MaxGroundVariation: 1.0 -> 1.1
  - All Game Enders except for the Scathis:
    - MaxGroundVariation: 1.0 -> 1.2

## AI

- Fix issue with T2 static artillery not receiving any surface threat during blueprint pass over.

## Other Changes

- Rework Seraphim weapon modules
- Refactor collision beam modules
- Fix a performance issue related to AIs and their transport logic
- Clean up the blueprint-files of various structures.
- Improve annotations for `OnMotionHorzEventChange` and `OnMotionVertEventChange`
- Annotate the shield assist mechanics of `RegenAssistMult`
- Ensure that the Cooper's hitbox aligns with its model
- Reduce the amount of logging performed by the game. This should have a positive impact on performance.
- Count cargo for veterancy when a transport or carrier is killed
- Improve the targeting of the Tempest's anti-torpedo weapon.
