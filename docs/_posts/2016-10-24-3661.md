# Hotfix Patch 3661 (October 24th, 2016)

- Reverted ping-related changes which caused desyncs. We will approach this again in future, but it will require some changes to a certain popular mod as well. Stay tuned.
- Reverted 'Fixed upgraded structures not being targetable via radar blip'. This is the second time this code approach has ended up being reverted. It appears to interact with the engine in an unstable fashion, causing hard core crashes.
