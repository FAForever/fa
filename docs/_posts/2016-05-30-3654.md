# Patch 3654 (May 30, 2016)

### Reverted

- The change in 3652 which refreshed intel for a blip on upgrade had unintentional free intel side effects we have been unable to solve. As such, that change has been reversed

### UI

- Fixed reductions in MaxHealth resulting in UI displaying 10000/9000 HP
- Added slot numbers in the lobby
- Toggling the shield on a selection of units with a mix of active and inactive shields now toggles them ON instead of OFF
- The tooltip now shows for ACU and sACU upgrades that are not yet buildable

### Bugs

- Reclaiming something under construction won't stall out any more
- Drones no longer display build-range rings
- UEF Drones no longer leave wrecks
- Fixed Seraphim Regen Aura level two not applying to newly built units
- Fixed Billy using the full 'Ignore shields' nuke code
- Fixed a typo in the Seraphim ACU which prevented the Gun upgrade from being completed
- Fixed Chrono Dampener getting jammed by Overcharge
- Fixed FX bug on Deceiver
