# Game version 3753 (25th of February, 2023)

See the patch notes of 3751 for the full patch notes.

## Bug fixes

- (#4741) Fix build preview of underwater storages

- (#4739) Fix Aloha being ignored by tactical missile defenses

- (#4740) Fix reclaim values of wreckages

- (acc6893) Enforce UTF8 encoding of preference file
  We weren't entirely aware that we stopped enforcing the encoding of the preference file. As a result a lot of people encountered issues. We hope by enforcing it again that those issues are resolved
