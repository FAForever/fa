# Patch 3658 (August 29th, 2016)

### Exploits

- Fixed an exploit where Factories and QGates could be made to build units at half-price

### UI

- UEF T2 Gunship will now display the transport icon when selected and hovering the mouse over one of your units
- Fixed typo in Seraphim ACU description
- Hydrocarbon Plants now use the amphibious background in the build menu
- Added rehost functionality to allow easy rehosting with the same game settings
- Enabled tooltips on queuestack, unitstack, and attachedunit entities (Shows tooltip when hovering over just about any unit build queue icon now)

### Lobby

- Fixed observer messages not showing in chat
- AI can now be swapped with real players
- The map previews now show the rating for each player slot currently assigned, and AI Names
- You can now set up your games via the map previews. Click on two players to swap them. Click an empty spot to occupy it.
- Fixed map preview highlights not going away when you exit the player switch drop-down menu in certain ways
- The color of your rating text now changes color, getting darker with higher deviation. This should make identifying smurf accounts easier.

- Added message "Player kicked by host" to chat

### Bugs

- Fixed death animations for Cybran T1 mobile artillery and Seraphim T3 mobile artillery
- Fixed soundbank errors in several units

- Paragon no longer does low damage to buildings and ACUs
- Fixed Size 4 buildings such as T2 PD and Flak getting a Rate-Of-Fire adjacency buff from PGens

- The Ythotha energy being only spawns for a completed unit
- Added pause button for Nuke Subs and Seraphim Battleship
- Nuke Launched warning now plays for Observers

- ACUs start rotated at middle of map as default
