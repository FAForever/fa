# Game version 3743 (23rd of August, 2022)

There's an issue with tactical and strategic defenses not working when Nomads is enabled. This is due to
changes to the base game done by patch 3741 that guarantees SMDs to function properly when there are
multiple strategic missiles on top of each other. We can't revert this change without re-introducing the
original bug that we're trying to fix.

We've reported the issue and the solution to the maintainers of the mod.

## Bug fixes

- (#4169) Fix internal state of HQs

  There was an issue with the internal state of the HQs, causing it to get corrupt. This was caused by a refactoring of
  patch 3741. If there are more issues with HQs then do report them on the forums or via Discord.

- (#4167) Fix text focus of mods manager after exiting

  You can now type again after exiting the mods manager as a non-host user :)!

- (#4165) Add guard for Blueprint.General for command caps

  Not having the guard broke a few mods, among one of them being SCTA.
