## Bug fixes

- (#5454) Fix a bug that can enable the Seraphim MML to launch an endless barrage of missiles.
- (#5454) Fix a bug where the command queue is stuck on a launch order.

This specifically occurred with the tech 3 strategic submarines and the tech 3 Seraphim battleship. As a result, the unit would be 'stuck' on the launch order, and any other order issued after the launch order would never be executed.

- (#5454) Fix a bug where distributed launch orders would not actually launch a missile.

This occurs when you issue launch orders and then distribute them. The new, distributed orders are processed and removed from the queue even though no missiles have been launched.
