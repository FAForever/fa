## Balance

- (#6705) Adjust cost of Aeon ACU's first range upgrade so that first range + speed matches the cost of other factions' gun upgrades. Equalize the individual costs of speed and range to make it harder to rush either upgrade on small maps.

  **Aeon ACU (UAL0001):**
    - First range upgrade:
      - Mass cost: 300 -> 400
      - Energy cost: 6000 -> 12000 (20 -> 30 energy per mass)
      - Buildtime: 350 -> 400
    - Fire rate upgrade:
      - Mass cost: 500 -> 400
      - Energy cost: 15000 -> 12000
      - Buildtime: 500 -> 400

- (#6843) Reduce the damage of the Cybran T1 mobile anti-air since its projectiles can now retarget, and it no longer needs so much damage to match the AA of other factions.

  **Sky Slammer: T1 Mobile Anti-Air Gun (URL0104):**
    - Nanodart Launcher (Anti Air)
      - Damage: 16 -> 14 (DPS 32 -> 28)

- (#6870) FAF significantly increased the uniform scales of both the Bulwark and the Mermaid. Overall, these changes were a bit excessive, with both (relatively cheap) units reaching approximately 2/3 to 3/4 the size of their faction's destroyer. Furthermore, FAF reworked the Bulwark to be cheaper but less effective, so from a gameplay perspective, there is no reason for it to be this large anymore. To prevent the already powerful Mermaid from becoming too strong, and to encourage more counterplay, its high HP/mass ratio has been reduced.

  **Bulwark: T2 Shield Boat (XES0205):**
    - Display
      - UniformScale: 0.135 --> 0.11
    - SizeX: 1.575 --> 1.4
    - SizeY: 1.35 --> 1.3
    - SizeZ: 4.125 --> 3.5

  **CI:18 Mermaid: T2 Counter-Intelligence Boat (XRS0205):**
    - Defense
      - Health: 1500 --> 1000
    - Display
      - UniformScale: 0.12 --> 0.10
    - SizeX: 1.25 --> 1.1
    - SizeY: 1.5 --> 1.3
    - SizeZ: 3.6 --> 3.2

- (#6880) Increase the reload time of the Seraphim T1 submarine's anti-torpedo defense so that it is less dominant against other T1 subs. This slows down their snowballing and allows for a transition into T2 counters (T2 subs, Coopers, Seraphim and Aeon destroyers).

  **Sou-istle: Seraphim T1 Submarine (XSS0203):**
    - Anti-Torpedo Defense reload time: 5 sec -> 13 sec

- (#6894) Nerf the Cybran ACU's Nano-Repair System, as it has proven to be an oppressive tool that causes Cybran ACUs to significantly overperform during both the Tech 2 and early Tech 3 stages.

  **Cybran ACU (URL0001):**
  - Nano-Repair System
    - Additional Regen Rate: 60 HP/s --> 50 HP/s

- (#6895) Further increase the `MuzzleSalvoSize` of the Cybran ACU's Nanite Torpedo upgrade to `4`, as it still had difficulties penetrating torpedo defenses after (#6476) increased it to `3`. Its DPS remains unchanged.

  **Cybran ACU (URL0001):**
  - Nanite Torpedo Launcher 
    - Damage (DPS): 60 (225) --> 45 (225)
    - MuzzleSalvoSize: 3 --> 4

## Bug fixes

- (#6796) Fix error when lobby rejects a data message with no sender name.

- (#6824) Fix factory upgrades disappearing upon completion.

- (#6830) Fix unit/projectile/weapon debug component logging and drawing causing desyncs.

- (#6835) Revert the change that made factories immediately start building after an upgrade or after cancelling a unit, since it seems to be causing occassional desyncs.

- (#6844) Fix error when eye of rhianne finishes building during an energy stall.

- (#6845) Fix various issues with the new setup for announcements.

In campaign-like scenario's the interactions with the objectives should now be good again.

- (#6868) Correct ACU threat values after they were accidentally miscalcuated in a previous PR. SurfaceThreatLevel from an average of 765 to 45.

- (#6871) Increase the `StrategicIconSize` of the Seraphim ACU's OC projectile to match that of the other ACUs.

- (#6879) Fix Cybran engis not turning wheels back to land mode after exiting water.

- (#6884) Fix being unable to build adjacent to the north or south side of an air factory that is building a continental.

- (#6891) Remove a redundant category from the unupgraded Cybran T2 Engineering Station (XRB0104).

- (#6898) Fix a desync-causing error when a player is defeated the same tick a recall vote is started.

## Graphics

- (#6763) Introduce a new slider to adjust the rendering distance of shadows

Strogo made the observation that the extensive (default) rendering distance of shadows can have a significant impact on the framerate. We increased the default rendering distance of shadows in FAForever two years ago. At the time we did not notice this impact. With these changes we turn it into a slider in the graphics options. The default value (260) matches the value used by Steam version of the game.

- (#6851) Push the rendering distance of tree (groups) to better match the values in Steam

After thorough testing we think it is safe to increase the rendering distance without running the risk to destroying the framerate of the average user. 

## Performance

- (#6826) Reuse unit categorization table instead of allocating a new one when issuing uncached formation orders.

- (#6853) Reduce conditional table accesses of projectiles when colliding or losing targets

- (#6854) Upvalue and localize frequently used functions and tables in formations
- (#6860) Reduce weapon damage table computations when applying buffs by storing constant data.

- (#6862) Reduce table accesses of projectiles especially on impact.

- (#6864) Remove unused lastAccel field from default projectile weapon salvo data.

- (#6866) Reuse tables when creating beam weapons instead of allocating new ones.

## Other changes

- (#6797) Remove the teleport reticle object from the command mode data.

- (#6798) Annotate WorldView control and ping sync data.

- (#6799) Annotate exit callbacks.

- (#6823) Proper type annotation for `GetCommandMode`.

- (#6828) Update the description of the Aeon ACU's vision upgrade.

- (#6832) Fix most annotation warnings in the new profiler code.

- (#6837) Improve annotations related to Buffs.
