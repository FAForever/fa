# Patch 3680 (11th May 2017)

### Gameplay

- New feature: Dead air unit wrecks now bounce off shields. The amount of bounce depends on the unit's momentum and angle of approach. Some of the crash damage is transferred to the shield. Unit wrecks can only bounce once. Doesn't affect Experimentals.
- Allow units in a transport which is shot down to leave wrecks at the crash site
- Allow the Novax to build a new Satellite if the old one dies. This can only happen if it is impacted by a Nuke or ctrl-k'ed
- Introduced code to slightly improve the way Tempest and Atlantis behave, particularly in being able to fire, in shallow waters
- Enabled fire states on TML and SML structures and units. This allows you to command multiple launchers to fire simultaneously at multiple targets
- Increased reconnect timeout from 45 to 90 seconds to better allow router reboots
- HARMS now sinks to a greater depth on completion
- Assist-Mex-To-Cap is now on by default

### Bugs

- Fixed ACU reclaiming while shooting
- Fixed ACU building while shooting
- Fixed Auto-Overcharge stopping working randomly until toggled

- Increased Beetle hitbox size and declared new targetbones to stop everything missing it if it strafes
- Fixed two move-while-building exploits
- Gave Force damage to several AOE weapons so they now kill trees properly
- Fixed ambient movement sounds continuing to play for sinking units

- Fixed the 'Select Onscreen Land/Air/Navy' hotkey also selecting the factories of that type
- Fixed the Mex Cap feature somehow allowing storage to be built inside units built via upgrade
- Fixed bug where the Aeon shields didn't visually rotate properly
