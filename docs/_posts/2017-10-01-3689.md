# Patch 3689 (1st October 2017)

### Bugs

- Veterancy
  - Fixed a bug that caused units to give 100% veterancy points instead of a fraction depending on their remaining HP on death when getting destroyed by self destruction.
  - Fixed ACUs giving too much veterancy to other ACUs when being killed.
- Fixed shields recharging many times faster than intended.
