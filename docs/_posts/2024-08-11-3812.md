# Game version 3812 (11th of August 2024)

A hotfix to fix three additional bugs.

With kind regards,

BlackYps

## Bug fixes

- (#6398) Fix a possible cause for a simulation freeze

It was possible to pass invalid numbers (NaN or infinite) as a ballistic acceleration for a projectile. This would cause the engine to freeze up. With these changes we introduce Lua guards to catch the invalid numbers and throw an error instead of passing the invalid number to the engine.

- (#6404) Fix upgrading units being duplicated when transferred after death.

- [#83](https://github.com/FAForever/FA-Binary-Patches/pull/83) Experimental units can now be attached to transports via script again.


## Other changes

- (#6399) Document method chaining of projectile engine functions
