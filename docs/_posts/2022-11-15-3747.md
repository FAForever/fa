# Game version 3747 (15th of November, 2022)

## Features

- (#4377, #4380) Improve reclaim overview
  Adjusts the colors, scaling and depth to better represent what is valuable.

- (#4387) Add toggle to enable / disable always showing splash damage
  It is off by default, you can find the toggle in the game options -> interface -> cursor features

- (#4393) Paint feature for observers
  Observers can now paint on the map and other observers can view each others paintings. Useful for
  casting to communicate to your viewers and fellow casters.

  Works by pressing the `ALT` key, can be adjusted in the game options.

  This feature also works in replays.

- (#4391) Improve rendering quality of water
  Slightly adjusts how water looks like in-game to make it look better overall

- (#4390, #4409) Add in missing tooltips for game options
  All the game options should now have a consistent tooltip.

- (#4385) Change default aix multiplier values
  Especially the AIs that can be found in the vault become complete beasts when they have
  twice the resources and build time. The default multiplier is now set to 1.5

  Note that you can change the AI multipliers in the lobby options

- (#4406) Prefetch session and unit assets
  Decreases the loading time when launching through the lobby. Assets of units are loaded
  as you play to reduce stuttering of the game.

  This is an experimental change.

- (#4405) Tweak network parameters
  Reduce the amount of lag that players experience by reducing the delay when messages are send.

  This is an experimental change.
