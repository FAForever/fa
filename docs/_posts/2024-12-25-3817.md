# Game version 3817 (25th of December, 2024)

A small hotfix for the autolobby. This will be the final patch for the game in 2024.

I’d like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who has contributed to FAForever this past year, as well as those who have contributed in the past. The FAForever project is possible because of your time and effort!

If you're interested in contributing then I encourage you to visit the forums and review the first pinned post in the contribution section. It provides an extensive overview of the currently documented roles in the community. Whether you're an (aspiring) artist, developer, or simply interested in writing well-structured texts — you are welcome!

I wish you all the best in the new year.

With kind regards,
Jip
