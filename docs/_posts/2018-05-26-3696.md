- Overcharge

  - The damage dealt by overcharge now scales with the amount of energy drained from storage.
  - Overcharge will drain as much energy as is required to kill any unit within the area of effect of the OC, or 90% of your stored energy.
  - One energy storage is required to unlock Overcharge.
  - One storage is required to kill T1 and T2 land units.
  - Up to three storages will be required to kill T3 land units.
  - The range of the Area of Effect is now displayed when using Overcharge.
  - The OC indicator will turn orange if you do not have enough energy in storage to kill the unit under the cursor.
  - The OC indicator will turn green if you have enough energy in storage to kill the unit under the cursor.
  - The maximum damage is 15k at a cost of ~45k energy
  - Damage vs buildings and vs commanders is unchanged from the previous system. We have added new icons to indicate whether you have enough energy to kill the unit under your
  - cursor. Gray is for idle, Orange means you dont have enough energy to kill and green means you will kill the unit if you OC it.

- Veterancy
  - The vet gained from buildings was too high, leading to problems especially with ACU TML.
  - Veterancy gained from damaging non-combat buildings is reduced by 50%
  - Only a single vet level can be gained for any one kill.
- Teleport

  - Teleporting takes 5 seconds longer. The animation at the teleport destination is unchanged.
