# Game Version 3780 (26th of January, 2024)

A new year that we can only start with new mechanics that are buggy!

With gratitude to all those who took the time to report issues,

Jip

## Bug Fixes

- (582be6d) Fix the Easy AI not working.

We often use the Easy AI as a testing platform.

- (#5854) Fix a bug where Auto Overcharge appears enabled but is actually disabled.

The bug occurs when the ACU attempts to use Auto Overcharge while enhancing. The Auto Overcharge behavior will be turned off but the UI was not updated accordingly. The UI now reflects this behavior.

- (#5853) Fix a bug when the Billy is redirected by a Loyalist.

The bug would generate an endless loop of explosions.

## Features

- (#5855) Give AI a notion of rating.

The rating shows in the lobby and in-game. The rating adjusts depending on whether it is a cheating AI, the cheating modifiers and the size of the map.

Note that games with AIs are unrated.

## Other Changes

- (#5840) Improve the English description of various Cybran units
