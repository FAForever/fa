# Game version 3816 (10th of December, 2024)

This hotfix primarily fixes the bug that rating and divisions were not displayed in matchmaker games.

With kind regards,

## Balance

- (#6568) Vulthoo have been underperforming after their rework. Their biggest weak point was the excessive amount of build time required which made it impractical to make them in the earlier stages of tech 2 especially.
    - Vulthoo:
        - BuildTime: 3300 --> 2700

## Bug fixes

- (#6546) Fix an exploit that allows being notified of enemy Billy nuke launches.

- (#6569) Fix the matchmaker lobby not passing ratings, divisions and clan tags to the session, making them not visible in the scoreboard.
