Patch 3688 (24th September 2017)
============================
### Balance
- Veterancy
    - Until now the veterancy system worked in such a way that the tech level of the units killed determined how many veterancy points a unit was given, and only the unit that got the killing blow would get the veterancy point(s).
    - With this patch we are moving from that tech based system to a mass based system. That means your units will get veterancy based on the mass of the unit that is killed. Your unit also doesn't need to get the killing blow to get veterancy. Once a unit dies all the units which damaged it will get veterancy points based on how much damage they did to that unit. There are also multipliers to adjust how much veterancy certain classes of units will require to vet up. We will watch closely for cases where veterancy may move to fast or too slow in certain fights and make any adjustments neccessary in upcoming patches.
    - The mass value of the ACU has been reduced to 2000 to avoid getting insane veterancy by killing an ACU
    - The amount of veterancy points that the ACU gains from higher tech units is reduced to avoid vetting too fast by overcharging mass heavy land units.
    - Experimental units only need to kill 50% of their own worth in mass to gain one veterancy rank.
    - Regular units need to destroy 200% of their own worth in mass to gain one veterancy rank.
    - Destroying a transport gives veterancy points for the cargo as well as the transport itself.
    - Unified regeneration values.
        - T1      +1  ->  1,  2,  3,   4,   5 regeneration
        - T2      +3  ->  3,  6,  9,  12,  15 regeneration
        - T3/ACUs +6  ->  6, 12, 18,  24,  30 regeneration
        - SACUs   +9  ->  9, 18, 27,  36,  45 regeneration
        - T4      +25 -> 25, 50, 75, 100, 125 regeneration

### Gameplay
- New Feature: Integrated a vastly improved version of the popular Notify mod
    - Notify Features
        - Notify started as a way to allow ACU upgrade progress to be communicated nicely to the team. FAF has taken it to the next level.
        - Support for sending notifications about ACU upgrades, Factory Tech upgrades (HQs), Experimental construction, and Nuke and T3 Artillery construction
        - By default, you will see notifications about ACU upgrades only, as well as an ETA overlay at the location of the upgrading ACUs
        - Toggles available to define which types of messages you want to see come in from allies
        - Notify messages limited to only show the first of each HQ type, Experimental (Non game-ender), Nuke, or T3 Artillery to avoid spamming the chat with notifications late-game
    - Notify UI
        - Selecting your ACU will show any upgrades it has completed for each slot above the UI in the bottom left corner
        - There is an in-game customisation menu UI. It can be accessed via the main menu, or with a key bind. Default binding is CTRL-ALT-F1
        - Full customisation of all Notify messages is enabled, including resetting to default
        - All message types are broadcast at all times. The menu allows you to customise which messages you see, using toggle buttons at the top of the customiser.
        - Colour of Notify messages can be changed inside the chat window
    - Upgrade Queuing

Patch 3672 (January 24th, 2017)
============================
- Fixed non-default team balance option breaking the anti-rating-bug code


Patch 3671 (January 19th, 2017)
============================
- Fixed an unintentional bug with hosting games with an AI introduced with the rating bug fixes below


Patch 3670 (January 17th, 2017)
============================
- Fixed the game reporting incorrect army indexes to the server on game start, leading to incorrect rating calculations on game end


Patch 3669 (January 17th, 2017)
============================
- Reverted that last one for a bit to fix an idiot bug


Patch 3668 (January 17th, 2017)
============================
- Fixed the game reporting incorrect army indexes to the server on game start, leading to incorrect rating calculations on game end


Hotfix Patch 3667 (December 22nd, 2016)
============================
- Fixed a typo which was setting the default labels to show onscreen to 10 rather than 1000


Hotfix Patch 3666 (December 21st, 2016)
============================
- The negative reaction of the community to the new Hotbuild bindings as defaults was severely underestimated. Attempting to reverse the change.


Hotfix Patch 3665 (December 21st, 2016)
============================
- Fixed a small error that cause the Unit Manager to hard crash


Patch 3664 (December 21st, 2016)
============================
### Bugs
- Removed deploy ability tooltip from Aeon T3 Mobile Artillery
- Fixed typos in two keybind descriptions
- Fixed Selen cloak being enabled out of the factory while moving, and further improved usability.
- Fixed civilians not always revealing for all players on map start
- Fixed beam weapons sometimes colliding incorrectly with projectiles
- Fixed sim slowdown when ordering mex cap with hundreds of engineers
- Fixed reclaim beam not penetrating water
- Fixed some remaining issues with the Reclaim overlay: Shifting while zooming/panning, and 'ghost' labels for props that are gone, as well as large performance improvement
- Fixed invalid preferences entries invalidating the game's share condition

### Gameplay
- Changed the ground weapon to be primary on Cybran switch-tech mobile AA units (T1, T3, Cruiser). This has no effect other than to allow attack-moving to work properly, stopping at the right range better.
- Ground fire is now set as the default firing state for all units
- Added a dummy weapon to units such as T2 Flak and Mobile Shields. This allows them to not run blindly in when a group of units is told to attack-move.

### UI
- New feature: Options setting is now available which will allow you to select your language from those available in FAF. Prompts for game restart.
- New feature: Options setting is now available that lets you choose the maximum number of reclaim labels allowed on-screen. Higher values cause significant FPS slowdown while the overlay is active.
- Removed Options toggle for reclaim overlay enable/disable. Simply unbinding it achieves the same thing.
- Redefined the default key bindings for Hotbuild to match a widely used community standard. This won't affect people who have non-default bindings set. Details found here: http://wiki.faforever.com/index.php?title=File:Hotbuild-layout-en.png
- New feature: Icons in the build and command menus for units will now show the keyboard shortcut assigned to them. Thanks to Brainwashed (AKA Washy/Myxir)!
- New feature: Icons in the selection menu are now sorted according to tech level and unit type. More thanks to Brainwashed!

### Coop
- Fixed a whole bunch of videos
- Fixed score screen so it works with coop
- Added a Feedback button for easier reporting of issues
- Giving units to an ally no longer breaks objectives
- Allowed armies to participate properly in objective requirements
- Fixed all AIs being set as UEF in coop
- Fixed Aeon Palace Shield breaking when given to an ally, and rebalanced it a little
- Fixed players other than the primary being unable to complete certain objectives

### Lobby
- New feature: Ability to click on the game title to update it, both in the lobby, and in the client's Find Games tab
- New feature: Closed slot - Spawn Mex. This option is used for the adaptive maps, letting a slot be turned on for mexes but not a player spawn
- Improved lobby setting persistence interaction with maps that introduce their own options
- Corrected "to observers" tooltip occurring twice
- Display mean rating in the rating tooltip, rather than minimum. Also use player name in that tooltip.
- Fixed closed spots showing an empty box for newly joined players, breaking the lobby
- Renamed 'Random' spawn option to 'Random - Unbalanced' for the sake of clarity
- Added ability for certain maps to modify the reclaim value of props
- Private messages now show 'From' and 'To' to make communication clearer

### Other
- Added Tamazight translation to FAF
- Improved a large number of Spanish translations
- Updated maps blacklist
- Fixed a shader error which cause water to render with jagged edges on some maps

Patch 3663 (November 12th, 2016)
============================

### Bugs
- Fixed a small oversight which led to non-cloaked units getting the cloak FX in a power stall
- Added cloak FX support for cloak fields (Mods only, FAF itself has no unit with this ability)


Patch 3662 (November 9th, 2016)
============================

### Bugs
- Fixed units dropping from a transport from teleporting closer to a pre-assigned target
- Extend improved Aeon TMD code to all forms, such as on ships (To catch high-flying missiles)
- Fixed steam effect not playing for units after teleport

### Gameplay
- Reworked Selen yet again to improve user interaction. Manual toggle shifts selection priority and toggles weapon off. Motion toggles stealth.
- Integrated visual cloaking effect from BlackOps mod to show clearly when one of your units is in a cloaked state

Hotfix Patch 3661 (October 24th, 2016)
======================================
- Reverted ping-related changes which caused desyncs. We will approach this again in future, but it will require some changes to a certain popular mod as well. Stay tuned.
- Reverted 'Fixed upgraded structures not being targetable via radar blip'. This is the second time this code approach has ended up being reverted. It appears to interact with the engine in an unstable fashion, causing hard core crashes.


Patch 3660 (October 24th, 2016)
============================
### Lobby
- Fixed team number switching slots alongside a player
- Added new feature: Kick Reasons. When kicking a player from your lobby, you get a new dialog. You may type in a reason for the kick to notify the player. If you blank it, or leave the message as presented, it will play the old message.

- Fixed rating labels being shown on the minimap when teams are not set to 'Fixed'
- Made it clearer that there's a search filter in the map selection
- Added new unit share conditions for interesting new gameplay. "Full Share" and "Share Until Death" have been joined by "Traitors", which gifts all your units to the player who killed you (Very interesting for FFA games), "Defectors", which is the opposite of Full Share, gifting your units to the highest scoring enemy, and "Civilian Desertion", which gifts your units to a neutral civilian AI, if there is one.
- Improved the tooltip when hovering over your score in the lobby. It will now show a more detailed explanation including your rating deviation
- Fixed the position of the load button in Skirmish mode when launching offline
- Fixed 'Odd vs Even' autoteam button for random faction being the same as the 'Top vs Bottom'

- Allowed UEF T2 Transport to be given targets while landed on water
- Enabled templates to be created with modded units as the primary unit
- New feature: Delayed Unit Transfer. Hold shift while giving a unit to another player to have it transfer once it finishes the command queue. Particularly useful when used with transports
- New feature: You can now cap mass extractors with storage by right-clicking a T2 or T3 mex, or double-shift-right-clicking an upgrading T1 or T2 mex, with an Engineer
- New feature: All ACUs now begin the game pointed towards the centre of the map, making things fairer between north and south on most maps

- Fixed Seraphim ACU weapon trail showing when zoomed out
- Fixed Neptune Class weapon getting stuck on during death sequence
- Fixed a large number of projectiles showing the trails through fog of war
- Fixed T3 Mobile Artillery not quite being able to fire to the edge of their radius in some circumstances

### Contributors
- Crotalus
- Downlord


Patch 3654 (May 30, 2016)
============================
### Reverted
- The change in 3652 which refreshed intel for a blip on upgrade had unintentional free intel side effects we have been unable to solve. As such, that change has been reversed

### UI

- UEF Drones no longer leave wrecks
- Fixed Seraphim Regen Aura level two not applying to newly built units
- Fixed Billy using the full 'Ignore shields' nuke code

Patch 3652 (May 2, 2016)
============================
### Lobby
- Name filter when selecting map
- Prevent host from changing player teams while he is ready
- Game quality in lobby now visible again
- Reduced autobalance random variation to get team setups with better overall quality
- Default to score off
- Stopped the map filter preventing the map selected in preferences from prior games from showing
- Tiny fix to flag layout
- Fixed descriptions for the AIx Omni option and Lobby Preset button

### UI
- Introduced Russian translations of many FAF additions to the game (Exotic_Retard and PerfectWay)
- Translate some FAF additions to Italian
- New keybindable action: 'soft_stop'
- Soft-stop will cancel all orders of a factory except their current one, if you soft-stop a factory with only one order it will get cleared
- Hold down Alt when giving a factory order to soft stop factory before issuing next order
- Multi-upgrade: Added UI support to upgrade structures several levels at once (i.e: cybran shields, hives, mexes, factories etc)
- Auto-overcharge: It's now possible to let overcharge fire automatically whenever you have the required power
- Order repair on a wreck to rebuild it if possible by some of the selected engineers. Those not able to rebuild the wreck will assist after the build starts.
- Units explicitly repairing (not assisting) a structure that dies will automatically try to rebuild it
- Refactor the income economy overlay not to show reclaim values appearing in the generated income column and do correct rounding of the numbers.
- Fixed bug with unit regen debuff not being visible in UI
- Fixed bug with buildpower not visible in unitview
- Score display in the top-right no longer counts reclaim into the Mass/Energy income shown in observer mode
- Allow Hotbuild to find Support Factories
- Allow the UI code to search active mods for unit icons. Mods will have to have the icons in the right place (/modname/icons/units/xxx_icon.dds). Confirmed working for Total Mayhem at least, and probably many more.
- Show ren_networkstats in Connectivity Screen (F11)
- Show name of the one resuming a paused game
- Reverted the change to T1 PD icons from 3641, so now they don't give free intel on mouse-over when trying to fake PD-wall with all-wall radar ghosts.

- Aeon ACU upgrade "Chrono Dampener" won't stun allied units any more. Additionally, it will fire at predetermined ticks so the effects of multiple acu's do not stack.
- Increased TMD range by 1 and ROF by 0.2s to prevent a single TML killing a single TMD by using ground-fire to impact before the second TMD shot fires.
- Fixed Cybran T3 MAA doing friendly damage on 1 of its 2 AA weapons

- Fixed Underwater Vision not being initialized on unit completion
- Fixed Engineers not properly reclaiming the target of an assisted, then stopped, Engineer
- Fixed UEF Drones being untargetable by Interceptors
- Fixed UEF Drone collision detection, making it much easier for ground-based AA to hit them
- Fixed UEF AI unit templates in coop mode
- Fixed an exploit with being able to upgrade restricted enhancements

    - The bug that caused resources to disappear when they got shared to several teammates and one of them had full storage does not exist and is a FAF urban legend. If a teammate has full storage, the resources get properly shared to a different teammate instead. It is not needed to use any mods to prevent resources from getting lost or to inform others about this "bug".
    - No change required
