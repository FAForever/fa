## I have a question

The community is available in various channels. For questions we encourage you to join the [FAForever Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mXahVSKGVb). There are separate channels for game development. We'd recommend the offtopic channel. There are various contributors available here to help find an answer to your question.

### Reporting bugs

A good bug report should make it immediately clear to a maintainer what the perceived bug is and possibly how to reproduce it consistently. The time of maintainers is relatively scarce, a detailed bug report is therefore not only appreciated but it also reduces the overhead of understanding the context of the bug. You can follow these guidelines to create a detailed bug report:

- Find an (preferably easy) approach to reproduce it in a sandboxed environment.

Once you've found a way to reproduce the bug you need to make sure that it is not related to a mod. Disable all your (ui) mods and try to reproduce the bug again. If the bug still occurs then do attach the replay id to your bug report along with a timestamp as to when the bug occurs.

- Open a [new issue on Github](https://github.com/FAForever/fa/issues/new?assignees=&labels=status%3A+novel+issue&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=) using the bug report template

In the issue you can add a description of the bug and relevant images or videos. You can add the replay id in the description. If you do not have a Github account then we encourage you to create one. Otherwise you can also report the bug on the [FAForever Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mXahVSKGVb).
